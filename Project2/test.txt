This recipe includes an ingredient called free-flowing brown sugar. This is a non-clumping or caking version of ordinary brown sugar. It has a lower moisture content then the traditional one, which makes it free flowing much like granulated sugar. It is available at most specialty supermarket. If it is not available in your part of the world, use regular brown sugar and make sure it is broken up, free of clumps. Macintosh or Granny Smith apples are the best choices for apple pie because they are the least mushy apples.
Place egg whites in a shallow bowl. In a separate shallow bowl, mix together cornmeal, herbs, salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Dip tomatillo slices in egg whites, then dredge in cornmeal mixture turning to coat both sides. Fry tomatillo slices 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until golden brown. Be careful not to over cook; tomatillos should be tender, but not totally softened. Serve immediately. A Tex-Mex variation on this Southern-American favorite. This version uses sour tomatillos instead of green tomatoes for a tangy bite! This dish is perfect served as a breakfast side dish, with red meat, or as part of a Mexican meal.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside. While the pasta is getting started, slice sausages lengthwise, and remove the casings. Brown sausages in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of the olive oil. Remove sausages to a platter, and keep warm in the oven. Add the bell peppers, garlic, oregano and basil to the skillet, and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Saute over medium heat until peppers are tender. Toss the pepper mixture with the drained spaghetti until well blended, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving platter, and arrange the sausages on the top. Garnish with Italian parsley and Parmesan cheese. This dish was inspired by a description in the novel, 'The Godfather.' It is also a favorite with my 'family.' Serve with a crusty bread, a green salad, and a robust dry red wine for a very satisfying meal. The amount of oil and garlic can be adjusted to your taste.
Prepare cake batter and bake in 13x9-inch pan as directed on package. Cool cake in pan 15 min. Pierce cake at 3/4-inch intervals with handle of wooden spoon, using turning motion to make large holes. Beat pudding mixes and milk in large bowl with whisk 2 min. Immediately pour half the pudding evenly over warm cake. Let remaining pudding stand 5 min. or until slightly thickened; spread over cake. Top with marshmallows. Refrigerate 1 hour. Heat broiler when ready to serve cake. Broil cake, 6 inches from heat, 1 to 2 min. or until marshmallows are golden brown. Cool slightly. Chocolate pudding 'poke' cake is topped with creamy chocolate pudding and a layer of toasted marshmallows for a treat everyone will love.
Preheat an oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Coat the outside of the eggplant with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Place on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until soft, 20 to 30 minutes. Allow to cool before coarsely mashing; set aside. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet. Fry the dried red chile peppers, cumin seeds, mustard seed, and asafoetida powder in the hot oil until the seeds start to splutter. Add the onions, green chile peppers, and curry leaves; cook and stir until the onions are soft and begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir the mashed eggplant, water, tamarind paste, jaggery, white sugar, turmeric, ground red pepper, and salt into the mixture; bring to a boil and cook until the mixture begins to thicken, 5 to 10 minutes. This is a classic Andhra dish consisting of roasted eggplant (brinjal) in a sweet and sour stew. The sweetness is from jaggery and the sourness is from tamarind. This pulusu is an excellent accompaniment to patholi, or mudda pappu (plain hard-cooked dal). I also like it just by itself with plain rice and ghee.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower; cover and steam until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Cool to room temperature. Blend cauliflower, mushrooms, and green onions in a blender under chopped, yet still chunky. Separate egg yolks and egg whites into 2 separate bowls. Beat egg whites in a bowl using an electric mixer until medium peaks form. Combine half-and-half, butter, and flour together in a saucepan over low heat; cook and stir until white sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Cool slightly. Stir white sauce, Parmesan cheese, cauliflower mixture, egg yolks, turmeric, salt, pepper, and curry powder together in a bowl; gently fold in egg whites using a spatula or wide knife. Pour egg mixture into a glass baking dish. Sprinkle paprika over egg mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and set in the middle, 30 to 35 minutes. This is a great quiche recipe - high in protein, which we need every day, especially as vegetarians. It is quick and relatively easy to make. All good cooks can adapt this recipe to their own requirements and availability of certain ingredients - but it tastes the best using the ones I have suggested here. If the ingredients are organic, they will be that much better.
Mix cantaloupe, tomatoes, red onion, cilantro, yellow bell pepper, jalapeno peppers, lemon juice, lime juice, and garlic together in a bowl. Add enough olive oil to moisten the salsa; season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until chilled and flavors have combined, 1 to 2 hours. This is the best salsa ever! The recipe was given to me by a friend and it always goes quickly. It's easy to double, and people always ask for the recipe so have extras on hand! I prefer fresh tomatoes, but the recipe calls for canned. You can also substitute any fruit to adjust it to your tastes. If you have a food processor or mini chopper, this recipe is much quicker and easier. Serve with Tostitos® Scoops!® chips. Enjoy!
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover completely with cold water. Bring water to a boil. Cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. In a small saucepan, combine the diced onion, sugar, black pepper, celery salt, mustard, vegetable oil, and vinegar. Whisk over high heat until all ingredients are well mixed and onions are translucent. Remove from heat and refrigerate until cool. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, spinach, iceberg,  bacon, croutons and onion rings. Toss together. Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat evenly. This is a wonderful salad with a fabulous dressing.  A true crowd pleaser!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together peanut butter, sugar, egg, and vanilla until well blended. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets. Use a fork to make a criss-cross pattern on the top. Make a small hole in the top of each cookie using the handle of a wooden spoon. Fill the holes with preserves. Bake for 8 to 11 minutes in preheated oven. Allow to cool for a couple of minutes on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely. Soft, tasty peanut butter cookies with a touch of jelly on top.  No flour needed.
Remove the turkey from refrigerator and allow it to stand at room temperature for about 45 minutes to an hour. While turkey is reaching room temperature, place a rack in the lowest position in an oven.  Line a large turkey roasting pan with heavy duty aluminum foil, and spray the lined pan with cooking spray.  Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Remove the giblets and neck from the turkey cavity, and set aside.  Wash and dry the turkey with paper towels, and rub the turkey with vegetable oil.  Sprinkle the turkey, inside and out, with lemon pepper seasoning.  Sprinkle the inside of the cavity with salt, and place the quartered onion, parsley sprigs, rosemary, and oranges in the cavity.  Sprinkle the area under the neck skin with lemon pepper seasoning, and stuff the area with a few slices of onion. Loosely tie the legs, and fold the wings underneath the turkey. Place the prepared turkey into the roasting pan.  Surround the turkey with the giblets and neck, remainder of sliced onion, and carrot.  Mix the white wine, cognac, chicken broth, and tomato juice in a saucepan and heat over medium heat until liquid is hot but not boiling.   Pour half the liquid into the turkey cavity and the other half into the pan.  Cover the turkey with more aluminum foil, making a tent so the foil doesn't contact the turkey skin.  Crimp the foil firmly over the edges of the pan to completely seal the turkey in the foil tent. Roast in the oven for 1 hour.  Remove the turkey from the oven, slit the foil tent, and fold the foil back to expose the turkey skin. Reduce oven temperature to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and roast the turkey for 1 more hour, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Fabulously moist.  Works every time.  And, yes, it really is a two-hour turkey! The trick is to use heavy duty, large size aluminum foil and then seal turkey in the foil completely. My new inlaws thought I was crazy when they arrived at our home to a cold, raw turkey one Thanksgiving. But they are believers now.
Divide the meat into 4 pieces, and flatten into thin beef patties. Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat until almost smoking, and cook the beef patties until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes per side; set the cooked burgers aside. Drain excess grease but leave any browned drippings in the skillet. In a shallow bowl, mix together 1 cup of flour with salt and black pepper. In a separate shallow bowl, beat the eggs until smooth, mixing in a half teaspoon of water if needed. Heat the vegetable oil in the skillet over medium heat. Dip both sides of cooked burgers into the eggs, then dredge in the seasoned flour; repeat 3 times to build up a thick coating on the burgers. Place the burgers into the hot oil, and pan-fry until golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Set burgers aside. Spoon away any excess vegetable oil. Melt butter in the skillet over medium heat, and stir to loosen any brown flavor bits left in the bottom of the skillet. Whisk in 1 tablespoon of flour until smooth. If you prefer a very thick gravy, use more flour. Gradually whisk in milk, cooking until the gravy is thick. Season to taste with salt and black pepper, and serve the gravy over the chicken-fried beef patties. A chicken-fried steak made with hamburger. Very nice flavor! Salt and pepper are your friends in this recipe.
To make harissa paste: Heat a dry skillet over high heat and add coriander, caraway and cumin seeds. Shake pan gently until spices become fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat and pour seeds into mortar and grind with pestle to a fine powder. Add garlic, salt, paprika and dried red pepper flakes, mashing and stirring until garlic is incorporated with the spices. Mixture will be dry and crumbly. Add enough of the 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil until you have a thick paste. Use fewer pepper flakes if you prefer less heat. Set aside. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil into a large pot and add minced onions and garlic. Cook slowly over low heat until onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Push onions aside in the pot, and stir in the anchovies.  Cook anchovies until they soften, mashing them with the back of a wooden spoon until they dissolve. Stir together with the onion and garlic mixture. Add the butternut squash, carrots, bell pepper, frozen peas and a pinch of salt. Stir and cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Pour in the stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for about a minute. Stir in the drained fava beans, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaf and harissa paste (from step 1). Add brown sugar and pomegranate molasses. Bring back to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for about 1 1/2 hours. The long, slow cooking time allows the flavors to deepen. Just before serving, stir in the chopped parsley. Top with the mint, if you like. This is called 'Middle-Eastern' fava bean stew and not 'Moroccan' because I have also borrowed flavors from my Lebanese roots. This stew came to me on a Saturday afternoon when we were desperately low on groceries and had no meat in the freezer. The first time my carnivorous partner tried it, he honestly thought it contained meat. I have made this many times, and he devours it with relish! To make this dish completely vegetarian/vegan, omit the anchovies. Serve with steamed basmati rice, couscous or bulgur.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).  Grease cookie sheets. Cream the butter margarine or shortening,  white sugar, eggs and vanilla. In a separate bowl, stir the  flour, 2/3 cup cocoa,  baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices.  Add flour mixture to butter mixture.  If too sticky add more flour, if too dry add a little milk.  Add nuts and mix with hands.    Must be of consistency to roll into little 1/2 - 1 inch balls. After you have cookie dough to handling consistency by adjusting it with either the flour or milk, roll into little balls, place on the cookie sheet and bake for about 10-12 minutes, cookie should be firm.  Do not overcook.  Remove from oven, let rest on the sheet for a few moments and remove to wax paper.  When cool, frost with confectioner's sugar and cocoa glaze. To Make Glaze:  Combine 4 cups confectioner's sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa, add about 1/2 cup milk.  Consistency should be of a glaze. Pour small amount of glaze over each cookie (about 1 tsp.).   Decorate with sprinkles while glaze is still wet. Italian, Christmas cookie, round, chocolate and spicy. The smell always gets me charged for the holidays.  The taste puts you in heaven.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Stir chicken, cream of chicken soup, roasted red peppers, salsa, sour cream, green onions, and chili powder together in a 12x8-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 15 minutes. Remove dish from oven and stir. Separate the breadsticks into 16 strips. Arrange the strips, lattice-style, over the chicken mixture, overlapping strips as necessary to fit the dish. Bake in the preheated oven until breadsticks are golden, about 15 minutes more. This is simple, but a pretty, chicken casserole.
Beat Cheddar cheese, cream cheese, sherry, curry powder, and salt together in a bowl; spread onto a serving platter into a 1/2-inch layer. Cover platter with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Spread chutney over cheese layer and top with green onion. So simple and good. Serve with crisp wheat crackers. Wheat Thins® are good.
Drain pineapple, reserving juice.  Sprinkle with salt. In a large frying pan, brown chicken in oil.  Combine cumin and cinnamon, and sprinkle over chicken. Add garlic and onion; cook until onion is soft.  Add reserved pineapple juice, tomatoes, olives, and salsa.  Cover, and simmer 25 minutes. Mix cornstarch with water; stir into pan juices.  Add bell pepper, and simmer until sauce boils and thickens.  Stir in pineapple chunks, and heat through. This dish, influenced by the cuisine of the Costa Brava region of northern Spain, marries the saltiness of olives and the sweet, tropical flavors of pineapple.  Serve over a bed of rice.
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, pour cream into large skillet.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until just about boiling.  Reduce heat, and add herbs, salt, peppers, onions, and parsley.  Simmer 7 to 8 minutes, or until thickened. Stir in seafood, cooking until shrimp is no longer transparent. Stir in cheeses, blending well. Drain pasta.  Serve sauce over noodles. This recipe is a hot one, but delicious!   If you are weak of tongue, then divide the amounts of peppers in half.  Better to add more than spoil your creation!  Bay scallops are preferred, but the larger sea scallops can be used if they are cut in half.  This dish can also be placed in a casserole dish and placed under the broiler until top turns golden brown!
Grease a baking sheet. Cut off 1/4 of the dough from 1 loaf and form into a pear-shaped ball for the bunny head. Form the remaining 3/4 loaf into a fat oval shape for the body. Place the body onto the prepared baking sheet and attach the head by pinching the 2 pieces together. Make narrow cuts, about 3/4 in deep, on each side of head for whiskers. Cut second loaf of dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll 2 pieces into 16-inch ropes. Fold each rope in half, and pinch the ends to the head to form ears. Cut the third piece of dough in half and shape into 2 ovals about 3 1/2 inches long for back paws. Attach the paws to the bottom sides of the body. Make two 1-inch cuts on the paws for toes. Cut the remaining dough into 3 pieces. Form 2 pieces into balls and pinch on sides for front paws. Divide the remaining piece of dough into 3 equal pieces and roll into 1-inch balls. Press the dough balls onto the  the face to form two cheeks and a nose. Press raisins onto the face to make eyes. Press almond slices close together onto face to make bunny teeth. Cover and let dough rise in a warm place until doubled, 30 to 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush the loaf lightly with beaten egg. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove to a wire rack to cool. To serve, line a serving platter with lettuce leaves and place the bunny in the center. I love this bunny bread. I make it every Easter and have it at my Easter dinner.  Sometimes I cut a hole in the tummy and fill with dip, or eat it as bread with dinner. S0 easy to make and my kids love helping me. I have also made this with rosemary bread and wheat bread.
Combine the rice and 4 cups of water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low; simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes. In a separate saucepan, whisk together the peanut butter, 1 cup hot water, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, garlic, green onions and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, and adding more hot water 1/4 cup at a time to maintain a pourable consistency. Bring about 1 inch of water to a boil in a large pot. Place the spinach and tofu into a steamer basket and set over the boiling water. Cover and steam until spinach has wilted and tofu is heated through, about 7 minutes. To serve, place spinach and tofu over white rice and smother in peanut sauce. I fell in love with this dish at my local Thai restaurant. Steamed spinach and baked tofu is smothered in a sweet peanut sauce. Serve over steamed white sticky rice. You can substitute chicken or other meat if you prefer.
In a 6 quart pot combine sugar and 7 cups water. Bring to boil and stir until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. Stir in tea powder while hot. Add orange juice concentrate, lemonade concentrate and 2 cups cold water. Chill in refrigerator. When cold mix in vodka. Pour into a plastic container leaving room on top for expansion. Freeze or 24 hours. To serve, scoop about 1 cup into a tall glass and quickly stir in 1/3 cup lemon-lime soda. Frozen slush drink. Good for the special event as it serves many drinks.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the zucchini, squash, onion, asparagus, and mushrooms in a large bowl; add in garlic, olive oil and sugar, and stir gently to coat vegetables. Spread vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast vegetables until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add bouillon cubes, wine, and orzo, and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain. Stir in roasted vegetables and Parmesan cheese, and serve warm. This is a recipe I made up with all of the wonderful summer vegetables in season. Serve it with chicken or all on its own!
Pound veal cutlets a few times with a meat mallet to tenderize, if desired. Beat egg with milk in a shallow bowl. Stir bread crumbs, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a separate bowl until well combined. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, or enough to cover the bottom of a skillet, over medium heat. Dip each cutlet in egg mixture and then in crumb mixture to coat. Fry the cutlets in the hot oil until browned, about 3 minutes on each side. Drain cutlets on paper towels. Heat 2 more tablespoons vegetable oil in the same skillet; cook and stir red bell peppers and onion in the hot oil until soft, about 8 minutes. Pour stewed tomatoes into vegetables and stir in water and sugar, dissolving sugar into the sauce. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Place veal cutlets into the sauce, cover, and simmer until veal is very tender, about 30 more minutes. This recipe has been in the family for generations. The meat is so tender and with the red pepper sauce, is so flavorful you'll want to make it at least once a week! I love serving this with a spring mix salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. Instead of scallopini, you can use veal cutlets and sometimes beef cutlets. The beef cutlets would take another 10 minutes longer cooking with the sauce.
Place the tofu, yellow onion, green onion, red pepper, garlic, mushrooms, tomato, and bacon in the bowl of a food processor.  Season with fish sauce, red wine, parsley, salt, pepper, curry powder, mustard powder, dill, and ginger; puree until smooth. Place an egg roll wrapper on your work surface with a corner pointing towards you.  Spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of the tofu mixture in between the center and bottom corner of the wrapper.  Fold the corner closest to you over the top of the filling, then fold in the left and right sides.  Moisten the top corner with a little water, and roll up tightly. Heat a few inches of canola oil in a large pot to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Fry the wraps a few at a time until the center has cooked and the outside is golden brown.  Drain on paper towels and serve hot. Who says tofu has to be healthy? Try this recipe, and I promise you'll never think of tofu the same way again.
Bring rutabaga to a boil into a large pot of salted water over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low; simmer until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).

Slowly whisk milk into flour mixture until thickened and creamy, about 5 minutes. Stir Cheddar cheese into milk sauce until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 3 minutes. Season with cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Transfer rutabaga to the prepared baking dish. Pour cheese sauce over rutabaga. Sprinkle bread crumbs and paprika over rutabaga. Bake in preheated oven until sauce is thickened and bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Great alternative to potatoes! A rich creamy homemade cheese sauce pepped up with a few select spices makes a great accompaniment to any meal!
Heat a grill pan over medium heat. Stir coconut milk, 2 tablespoons cilantro, 2 tablespoons green onion, lime juice, ginger, garlic, and fish sauce together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Brush the mahi mahi fillets with enough sauce to coat. Cook the remaining sauce at a boil until slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Cook the mahi mahi in the grill pan until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter, top with the sauce, and garnish with 2 tablespoons cilantr and 2 tablespoons green onion to serve. This mahi mahi dish pairs well with steamed squash.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine and olive oil, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat.

This linguine is served with a buttery thyme and roasted red pepper sauce. It is delicious.
Place the basil, pine nuts, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, water, and soy topping into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Honestly, I really never liked pesto. However, now that I am tasting things so clearly (as a vegan), I LOVE the stuff! Here's my new, favorite Presto Pesto!
Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain. Combine milk and vanilla bean in a saucepan over medium-heat. When the milk begins to bubble, remove and discard the vanilla bean. Add chocolate chips to milk; whisk continuously until chocolate is melted. Mash potatoes in a large bowl. Add milk-chocolate mixture to potatoes and stir until combined. Add cheese and mash together with potatoes; season with salt. White chocolate and vanilla in your mashed potatoes? You'd be surprised how delicious this combination is. The chocolate adds the richness of butter and extra creaminess to the spuds. Give this one a try!
Spread sauerkraut into the bottom of a slow cooker crock. Arrange knockwurst atop the sauerkraut. Pour beer over the knockwurst. Cook on Low for 5 hours. Put apples into the slow cooker and continue cooking for 1 hour more. Wonderfully warm German comfort food that's a cinch to prepare.
DAY BEFORE:  Cream butter and cream cheese together until smoothly blended. Beat in the flour.  Shape dough into a smooth ball, wrap in foil or cling wrap, and refrigerate overnight or up to a week. AT BAKING TIME:  Remove dough from refrigerator 30 minutes before using.  Start heating oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll chilled dough thin. Cut with 3 or 4 inch round cookie cutter.  Place small spoonful of jam in center of each round, moisten edges with water. Fold round over and press edges together.  Bake on ungreased cookie sheet 15 to 20 minutes.  Immediately roll in sugar mixed with cinnamon (traditional) OR in confectioners' sugar if preferred. Better make plenty - these disappear fast.  The unbaked dough may be frozen. The baked cookies may also be frozen.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets, or line with parchment paper. Have fortunes ready to go on small strips of paper. In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites and sugar on high speed of an electric mixer until frothy, about 2 minutes. Reduce speed to low, and stir in melted butter, vanilla, almond extract, water and flour one at a time, mixing well after each. Consistency should resemble pancake batter.  Spoon the batter into 3 inch circles on the prepared baking sheets. Leave room between for spreading. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges begin to brown slightly. Quickly remove one at a time, place a message in the center, and fold in half. Fold the ends of the half together into a horse shoe shape. If they spring open, place them in a muffin tin to cool until set. Taste and look just like the ones you get at a Chinese restaurant!  I was very pleased with my first attempt baking these!  Adding your own personalized message allows you to create great favors for any occasion! Alternatively, I have rolled these into tube-like cigar shapes and filled them with icing for other occasions which have been a crowd pleaser!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, honey, horseradish, cayenne pepper, and hot pepper sauce together in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Place English muffins, cut-side up, on an ungreased baking sheet. Place 1 slice Canadian bacon on each muffin. Spoon 1/4 cup of egg mixture on top of bacon and sprinkle with pepper jack cheese. Top with green onions. Bake in preheated oven until cheese melts, 6 to 8 minutes. This is a delicious, quick, and easy breakfast main dish with a spicy kick to get you going in the mornings.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour two 8 x 4 inch loaf pans. Combine flour, sugars, pumpkin, oil, coconut milk, baking soda, salt, and spices.  Mix until well blended.  Fold in coconut and nuts.  Pour into prepared pans. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.  Remove from oven.  Cover with foil tightly, and allow to steam 10 minutes.  Remove foil, and turn out onto cooling rack.  Tent lightly with the foil, and allow to cool completely. This bread takes pumpkin bread to a whole new realm. I invented this one day when thinking of how to make pumpkin bread retain its moistness even longer. Solution: coconut milk!
In a saucepan over medium heat combine the sugar, salt, cornstarch, water, and chocolate. Stirring frequently bring to a boil and cook over low heat until thick. Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and the butter or margarine. Mix well. Let frosting cool before frosting cake. This recipe quickly makes a thick pudding-like chocolate frosting that goes great on whatever cake you like.
Arrange onion slices evenly over the bottom of the slow cooker, and then place the roast on top of the onion.  In a bowl, mix together water, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, ketchup, black pepper, salt, garlic powder, and hot sauce; pour over roast. Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours, or on High for 3 to 4 hours. This recipe is a favorite with my husband. I usually serve it with buttered egg noodles and sugar snap peas.
Stir together the water, sugar, and peanut butter until smooth. This is a sweet peanut butter glaze, great on top of pastries or brownies and especially Danishes!
In a large pot over medium high heat, saute the bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon and some of the fat; drain and set aside. Keep about 2 tablespoons of fat in the pot, add the flour and stir well to form a roux. Heat the roux until it is a dark brownish color, about 5 minutes. Add the onions, celery, sesame oil and carrots to the roux and saute for 2 minutes, stirring well. Add the garlic and heat for 2 more minutes. Add the water and stir well. Finally, add the white beans, black beans, cayenne pepper to taste and ground black pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium low and simmer for 2 hours, or until the vegetables and beans are tender and the soup is the consistency you want. If the veggies aren't tender but its too thick, you can always add more water. Return the bacon to the soup and season with salt to taste. A meal in itself. This recipe could easily be made meatless. I sometimes serve it over rice for a whole meal, or by itself as a hearty soup.
In a medium bowl, mix together mayonnaise, sour cream, Italian-style salad dressing mix, curry powder, dried minced onion flakes, dried parsley, lemon juice, salt and Worcestershire sauce. Chill in the refrigerator until serving. This recipe will guarantee they eat their raw veggies! It is SO great!  My grandpa 'invented' it years ago and we have been making it since!  Anywhere I take it people want the 'secret' recipe!!! It's actually a simple blend of mayonnaise, sour cream and seasonings. It is best chilled overnight to bring out the flavor!!  ENJOY!
Place ingredients into the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select Whole Wheat cycle, and Start. After the first rise, remove dough from the machine. Shape, and place into a lightly oiled 9x5-inch loaf pan. Cover, and let rise for 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees C (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Remove from oven, remove from pan, and let cool completely on wire rack before slicing. This is a hearty bread. Mix it in the bread machine (or stand mixer) but bake it in the oven. I recommend baking in the oven instead of the machine because the loaf is fuller and the top is much nicer. I hope you enjoy it.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheet. Combine peanut butter, eggs, and sugar and mix until smooth. Mix in chocolate chips and nuts, if desired. Spoon dough by tablespoons onto a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned. Let the cookies cool on the cookie sheets for 5 to 10 minutes before removing. This recipe is gluten-free and delicious!  Pecans are great in these, but feel free to use peanuts or any other nut you choose.
Blend tomato juice, olive oil, vinegar, shallot, Worcestershire sauce, onion powder, and dry mustard together in a blender until smooth. Tomato vinaigrette made with tomato juice, shallots, and the right amount of seasoning goes quite nicely with any salad.

Pour the marinade from the jar over the cheese slices, cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight. To serve, remove slices to a serving platter so they are still arranged in an alternating pattern. Spoon some of the extra marinade over the cheese, and serve with crackers. This is a very colorful and tasty appetizer.  Because it has such a stunning presentation, it is a great appetizer for the holidays.  I take this to every function and gathering we attend - only because everyone else requests it!

Roll out remaining dough, and cut into two rectangular roof pieces. Transfer gingerbread onto greased baking trays. In a preheated 375 degree F (190 degrees C) oven, bake gingerbread for 10 minutes, or until crisp. When removing from the oven, leave the gingerbread on the baking trays for a few minutes to set, then transfer to wire racks.  Leave out overnight to harden. In a large bowl, lightly whisk 2 egg whites. Gradually beat in approximately 5 cups confectioners' sugar. The icing should be smooth and stand in firm peaks. Spread or pipe a 9 inch line of icing onto a cake board, and press in one of the side walls so that it sticks firmly and stands upright.  If necessary, spread  or pipe a little extra icing along either side to help support it.  Take an end wall and ice both the side edges.  Spread or pipe a line of icing on the board at a right angle to the first wall, and press the end wall into position.  Repeat this process with the other two walls until they are all in position.  Leave the walls to harden together for at least two hours before putting on the roof.  Spread or pipe a thick layer of icing on top of all the walls, and fix the roof pieces in position; the roof should overlap the walls to make the eaves.  Pipe or spread a little icing along the crest of the roof to hold the two pieces firmly together.  Leave overnight to set firmly. When ready to decorate, make the remaining icing.  In a large bowl, lightly whisk 4 egg whites, and mix in remaining confectioners' sugar as before.   Use this to make snow on the roof, and to stick various candies for decoration. Finish with a fine dusting of sifted confectioners' sugar. This is one my mum in England used to make when we were kids.  It was always the biggest hit every year.  Use your imagination and a variety of candies to make doors, windows, pathways, and a garden.  Note, this gingerbread house takes 2 to 3 days to complete. You can buy a variety of candies for decoration.

A very simple and classic Greek recipe. Top with grated Mizithra, Parmesan, Kefalotyri, or any other hard, white, and salty cheese.
Place each trout on a piece of aluminum foil.  Season to taste with salt and pepper, then stuff the cavity with 1 tablespoon of butter, green pepper and garlic if using. Roll the trout tightly in the foil, forming packets.  Use some additional foil to secure each packet of fish to a metal toasting rod for use as a handle when removing fish from the coals. Cover the fish packets in the red hot, smoldering coals of your campfire and cook until the fish is done, 7 to 10 minutes, depending on the heat of the fire. My dad taught me how to prepare the trout we caught fresh on camping trips when I was a kid.  I always loved the buttery flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture!

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Cut each of the puff pastry sheets into 9 pieces; you should have 18 total. Roll the pieces out, one at a time, to make 5 x 5-inch squares. To ensure the pastries puff up, avoid using too much pressure or rolling over the edges of the dough. Place a square in front of you so that it looks like a diamond. Spoon a generous amount of cheese filling down the middle of each square, leaving 1/4 inch of room at the top and bottom edges. Fan out 4-5 slices of apple down the center of each cheese-filled square. Bring the left and right corners together to meet in the center and pinch to seal. Transfer the Danish to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining pastries. Sprinkle sugar over each bundle and bake in the preheated oven until the pastry is golden brown, about 20 minutes. This is a great recipe and looks like it came from a professional bakery. It isn't hard--just a little time-consuming.

Gently stir the mixture to distribute chocolate chips throughout the oats mixture; spread onto a flat, shallow pan to cool completely. Divide peach slices between 2 bowls. Sprinkle oats mixture over the peaches. A chewier version of a no-bake peach cobbler or peach crisp. I make this for my husband in our 'down home' farming community where Calhoun County peaches are extra-sweet! The peaches must be in their peak season to be sweet enough; canned peaches will not be as good!
In a bowl, lightly mix the Swiss cheese, green onions, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, and mayonnaise. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours to blend flavors. Mix in more mayonnaise before serving, if desired. To serve, cut core out of cabbage and discard. Cut a thick slice from the bottom of the cabbage; use a fork to pull the inner leaves out of the cabbage to leave a hollowed out bowl.

Festive appetizer served in hollowed out whole red cabbage -- accompanied by corn chips! Beautiful, easy, and oh so tasty! Especially pretty for Thanksgiving and Christmas appetizer buffets. Best if made ahead at least 24 hours to let flavors blend (can refrigerate in covered container for up to one week). Even with peppers, this dip is not too spicy -- children love this dip. A winner!

Cook until eggs are set. Garnish omelet with tomato and green onion and serve warm. There's nothing too fancy about this rustic Spanish style omelet, just lots of hearty goodness from crispy fried potatoes and onions. Chopped tomatoes and green onions lend even more flavor and color.
Stir the cream cheese, sour cream, jalapeno pepper, salsa verde, red salsa, onion, lime juice, and chili powder seasoning together in a bowl until well blended.

Bring 4 quarts lightly salted water to a boil in a large pot. Between two sheets of plastic wrap, pound turkey breast pieces to an even 1/4-inch thickness with a meat mallet. If you don't have a meat mallet, the back of a frying pan will work fine. You can do this a day ahead and leave them stored in the plastic wrap, folded over on each other. You can also ask a good butcher to cut and pound the turkey for you. Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Lightly coat the turkey pieces with flour, and pat off the excess; dip in beaten eggs and then dredge in bread crumbs.  When oil is hot an bubbling, add turkey pieces. Do not crowd the pan. Let brown 2-3 minutes, then turn to cook the second side, another 30 seconds to 1 minute. The turkey will cook very quickly and will dry out if overcooked. When done, remove to a baking sheet or platter and keep warm. Do not wash saute pan! To make the sauce, add butter to saute pan and place over medium-high heat. At the same time, drop ravioli into the boiling water. When butter begins to turn light brown, add fresh sage. Stir for a few seconds; then add cranberries, and saute until skins begin to burst. Add molasses, balsamic vinegar, and broth, scraping bottom of the pan to pick up all the flavor of the turkey. Simmer until cranberries are soft and the sauce coats the back of a spoon, about 12-15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Be sure to taste sauce for seasoning before you pour it over the turkey! Test ravioli for doneness in about 3 minutes--pinch edges of dough; it should be tender. Drain. Arrange 1/4 of the raviolis per person on hot plates and layer a piece of turkey over the ravioli. Spoon sauce over them. Thin pieces of turkey breast are breaded and browned, then served over squash ravioli and topped with a rich sage-cranberry sauce.

Combine all ingredients in a jar, and let sit for at least an hour to steep the flavors in the oil.  Sprinkle generously on the lettuce in your sub or directly on the insides of the bun. This sounds absurdly simple but is wonderful, especially when really great Italian meats and cheeses are used; but it really jazzes up routine lunch meats on a sub, too.  I highly recommend the addition of a good dollop of Holland House hot cherry pepper relish.  It's heavenly - had it at a sub shop on Boylston Street in Boston in the 70's and dreamed about it for years.  Finally discovered it at an Italian grocery in Seattle and was thrilled to discover that same fabulous flavor.  Try it, you'll love it!

Sprinkle salsa with salt, garlic powder, and black pepper and stir salsa again. Refrigerate at least 3 hours to blend flavors. This is a recipe I came up with while trying to figure out what to do with an over-abundance of rhubarb. I'm not fond of sugary, syrupy rhubarb sauces but I love rhubarb and I love salsa, so I figured why not put them together! Just grab a bag of tortilla chips, or better yet make your own, and enjoy! Feel free to adjust ingredients to your liking. Don't like jalapenos? Don't use them. Mix and match peppers however you like, just be sure to use 3 of them. Also, I prefer Nellie and Joe's® lime juice because it's a bit more tart than regular bottled or fresh-squeezed lime juice, but if you can't find it that's fine, just use what you have.

Mix the cheese sauce with milk until smooth and pour over the potatoes. Set the slow cooker to High and cook for 6 hours. This is my husband's favorite way to have pork chops. They stay nice and moist in the slow cooker. You can also cook in a 350 degree F/175 degree C oven for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Spread thawed edamame in a roasting pan and drizzle with sesame oil and olive oil; sprinkle with sesame seeds, chili powder, garam masala, salt, and black pepper. Toss to combine and spread out evenly. Roast edamame in the preheated oven until slightly browned in spots, about 20 minutes. Stir edamame after 10 minutes, then after 5 more minutes. Remove from oven and set aside. Place shrimp bouillon cubes, water, and lime juice in a large saucepan and bring to a boil. Stir in jasmine rice, cover saucepan, and simmer over low heat until liquid has absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork. Remove from heat and stir in coconut milk, roasted edamame, and toasted coconut. Season to taste with salt and black pepper if desired. I concocted this recipe while trying to come up with creative ways to use edamame, which is one of my favorite things to eat.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Cut pears in half lengthwise and remove core with a melon baller or small spoon. Place pears, cut side down, in a shallow baking dish just large enough to hold them. Pour apple juice and water over pears; drizzle with honey. Cover pan loosely with foil and bake about 35 minutes or until tender. While pears are baking, place granola in a shallow baking pan or pie plate and toast in oven 10 minutes; set aside. When pears are done, pour baking liquid into a small saucepan and reduce over medium heat until about 1/4 cup of syrup remains; set aside to cool. Line a colander with paper towels and place over bowl to catch drips. Pour yogurt into colander and allow to drain about 30 minutes. Divide yogurt among 4 shallow bowls. Place warm pear half, cut side up, over yogurt. Top with toasted granola and drizzle with syrup. Garnish with a mint leaf, if desired. This dessert is a mix of great tastes and textures: baked pears drizzled with honey and topped off with crunchy granola, and cooled down on the yogurt. Made with nutrient-rich, low-fat yogurt, this dish does contain lactose, but the live and active cultures in yogurt help with digestion  making it a friendly option for those who are lactose intolerant.
In a 2 quart saucepan, combine water and rice. Cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes. In a medium size bowl, combine the chicken and curry powder, and toss to coat. Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Cook the chicken, stirring frequently, over medium-high heat for 4 minutes. Mix in the asparagus, snow peas, carrots and green onions; cook for 3 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk , continue cooking until sauce is hot, and chicken is cooked through.  Serve over the hot, cooked rice. This dish is super easy and lower in fat too!
Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk almond milk, applesauce, eggs, and almond extract together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to almond milk mixture and stir until batter is just moistened. Stir granola and almonds into batter. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. This was a very good basic pancake recipe, but I wanted to add a little something to make them healthier and give them some substance. I also substituted the oil with applesauce! They came out great and all 3 of my kids loved them! The recipe made 20 pancakes; you can halve it if you do not need that many. I freeze the extras for another day!
Place sour cream and buttermilk into a mixing bowl. Season with parsley, chives, garlic powder, dill, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk together until smooth. Cover and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving. If you do not like mayonnaise, this recipe is for you!  It's so creamy, you'll never be able to tell that it's reduced fat!
Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and cook the onion until tender. Mix in cocoa powder, cumin, cilantro, and garlic. Stir in the tomato soup and green chile peppers. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 10 minutes. Transfer to a gravy boat or pour directly over food to serve. This is a good version to make with ingredients you can keep on hand. Serve with a rotisserie chicken or your own cooked chicken to give it an entirely different flavor. Rice and/or tortillas plus salad greens, sliced avocado, and chopped tomatoes round out a simple but special meal.
Preheat oven 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Stir together sifted flour, salt, cornstarch  and sugar. Add salad oil and  egg whites and stir until smooth. Gradually stir in water just until blended. Foil cover the cookie sheet.  Drop level tablespoon of batter for each of 6 cookies.  Use back of spoon to spread batter evenly into 4 inch circle. Bake  for about 20 minutes. Remove one cookie at a time from the oven with a wide spatula; working quickly follow these four steps:   1.  Flip cookie onto cotton gloved hand   2.  Hold fortune in center of pliable cookie while folding cookie in half   3.  Grasp ends of cookie and draw gently down over edge of muffin pan to crease at center of cookie   4.  Fit cookie in muffin pan (points down) to hold shape as it cools   If cookie hardens too quickly, return to oven for about 1 minute.   Store in airtight container. They are not Chinese in origin, but the innovation of an enterprising baker in Los Angeles in the 1920's.  Be sure to have cotton gloves and a muffin pan handy.  And, don't forget to have all your 'fortunes' written and ready in 1/2 x 3 inch strips.
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; stir in the curry and cook 1 minute. Add the onion and garlic; cook 8 to 10 minutes, or until the onion becomes transparent. Stir in the peaches, including their syrup, with the tomatoes, ginger, cream, broth, salt, and pepper. Simmer over low heat for 45 minutes. Serve hot, topped with shrimp and lettuce. A friend who used to work as a chef shared this yummy and oh, so simple recipe with me. You may substitute half-and-half or evaporated milk for the cream to cut some fat.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small mixing bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add 1/3 cup sugar and beat until smooth. Thoroughly mix in 1 egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Do not overbeat. Spread mixture into pastry shell. Sprinkle with chopped pecans. In a medium bowl, combine 3 beaten eggs, corn syrup, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, salt, cinnamon, and cloves. Mix until incorporated but not frothy. Pour mixture over pecan layer. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, until filling is set and pecans are browned. Pie will be quite high, but will settle as it cools. Two pies in one: spicy pecan and tender cheesecake. Comes out of the oven with the layers switched! Looks like a cheesecake but a surprise is underneath.
Whisk hot sauce, honey, and brown sugar together in a saucepan until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, whisking frequently. This sauce tastes similar to the sauce used on the sticky fingers at one of my favorite restaurants.  It is easy to make and has endless possibilities for modification.  Try adding a bit of cinnamon or cloves to it.  Honey is used to thicken the sauce, but isn't necessary.  If not using the honey, just use extra brown sugar.
Place smoked pork butt in a 6-quart pot with enough water to cover; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 1 hour. Stir in potatoes and cabbage. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Remove pork from soup and cut into quarters; return pork to pot until ready to serve. Season with more salt and pepper, if needed. This was a recipe my Mom had and we ate it every St. Patrick's Day.  An alternative recipe for St. Patrick's Day for those who don't care for corned beef and cabbage.  Cooked together in one pot and boy is it juicy! My mom is Irish and hated the traditional corned beef, potatoes, and cabbage version. She got the basis for this recipe from her Italian Mother in Law. Add a nice warm crusty roll, butter, and a pint of Guinness or Pinot Noir and you got yourself a hearty meal to celebrate the Irish!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with foil liners. Crush graham crackers and 2 tablespoons ground ginger together in a resealable plastic bag; pour into a bowl. Add butter to graham cracker mixture and mix with a fork or pastry blender until blended. Beat cream cheese, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a large bowl until creamy; beat in pumpkin puree. Add cinnamon, 1 tablespoon ginger, nutmeg, cloves, and salt; add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Press 1 tablespoon graham cracker mixture into the base of each prepared muffin cup, pressing mixture slightly up the sides of the liners. Fill each cup with cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until tops are smooth and cupcakes jiggle slightly when moved, about 15 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool. Stir sour cream, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until frosting is smooth. Top each cupcake with frosting and sprinkle with cinnamon. After deciding against buying a springform pan, but wanting cheesecake for Thanksgiving, I combined a few recipes to get this final product. It got great reviews from all the family! These cupcakes really should be made the day before, as well as the frosting. I store mine in tupperware in the fridge so they set up nicely.
In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt and water until a soft dough is formed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Divide dough into golf ball size pieces and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Select a ball of dough and roll out until very thin but not torn. Sprinkle lightly and evenly with sugar. Fold up dough into a small square and roll out again until thin. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Place the rolled dough onto the pan and cook for 1/2 to 1 minute on each side until golden. Serve immediately. Repeat until all dough balls have been rolled and cooked. This recipe is an old family favorite. A crisp and sweet flatbread that's fried on the griddle. Everyone in my family loves it!
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.  Grease a 9x13 inch pan. To make Filling:  In a saucepan over low heat,  combine dates, water, white sugar, and lemon juice. Heat for about 8 minutes, or until thick.  Set aside to let cool. To make Pastry:  In a large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar, oats and salt. Mix until well blended.  Add in shortening until mixture forms into coarse crumbs. Press half of pastry mix into pan.  Cover with date mixture and spread remaining pastry mix over the top. Bake 20 to 25 minutes until golden brown.  Let cool on wire rack before cutting. These bars taste just like oatmeal cookies!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place the pine nuts on a cookie tray, place in oven for 5-8 minutes at 350 until lightly browned. Separately, place ravioli in large pot of boiling water, cook to package instructions, about 8-10 minutes. Sift out with large draining. Separately, in sauce pan, saute olive oil, garlic and mushrooms for 1-2 minutes. Add Margherita(R) Prosciutto. Saute until garlic and prosciutto are light brown then add Amaretto, allowing it to flame/burn off, then add the butter. Once butter is melted, add chicken stock. Reduce heat and simmer for 2-3 minutes. Turn off heat and add baked pinoli nuts. Ladle out sauce onto ravioli in pasta dish, garnish with fresh sage (may also fry sage leaves to crispy for garnish). Savory Margherita® Prosciutto, sautÃ©ed garlic, mushrooms and pine nuts over sweet pumpkin ravioli in a rich buttery Amaretto sauce.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir peaches, 1/2 cup sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Let sit for 20 to 30 minutes. Strain accumulated juices into a saucepan and return strained peaches to bowl. Bring juices in saucepan to a boil; reduce heat to medium-high, and cook until mixture thickens to a syrup, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk 1/2 cup sugar, flour, and cornstarch together in a bowl. Stir lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon into peaches; add flour mixture and toss to coat. Pour peach syrup over peach mixture and stir. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 10-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate. Pour peach filling into pie shell, tap pie plate against a surface to settle filling, and dot with butter. Roll remaining crust into an 11-inch circle and cut into 1-inch strips using a paring knife or pastry wheel. Lay 5 strips of pie crust over the top of the pie. Weave remaining pastry dough strips through to form a lattice top. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the bottom crust and crimp the crust. Brush cream over the top and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbling, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Cool completely before slicing. Above and beyond beautiful, this lattice design is also very practical. When you're making pie with something like peaches, the relatively open top allows for lots of moisture to evaporate, which helps prevent the dreaded 'watery-pie syndrome.' That's also the reason we boil the excess juices down to a syrup.
Place black beans, white beans, tomatoes, and kale in a slow cooker. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion to the slow cooker. Sprinkle with chili powder, garlic and herb seasoning, and salt. Place the chicken breast halves on top, then pour the chicken broth into the slow cooker. Cook on Low for 6 hours. Remove the chicken breasts, and shred or cut the chicken into bite-size pieces. Stir the shredded chicken back into the chili. Stir in the heavy cream, allow to heat for a few minutes, and serve. Beans, greens and chicken come together with tomatoes in a thick and creamy broth. This recipe, as with most chili recipes, doesn't need to be exact and can be altered to fit your taste or what you have on hand. The choice of greens is up to you - my first choice is kale, but you can use spinach, turnip greens, collards or a combination (my favorite)!  If you use fresh greens, wash and chop them very fine before adding them to the slow cooker.
In a large mixing bowl place figs and sprinkle with baking soda.  Pour the boiling water over the figs and soak for 1 hour. Drain figs and rinse thoroughly with cold water.  In a large Dutch oven combine the sugar and the 4 cups of water; bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. Add the figs and lemon slices to the syrup in the Dutch oven and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Spoon figs into hot, sterilized jars and spoon syrup over figs, leaving 1/2 inch of head space.  Top jars with lids and screw bands on tightly.  Process for 10 minutes in a hot water bath. Fig Preserves

Place the turkey legs into the slow cooker and cover with the sauce. Set the slow cooker to High, and cook for 3 hours, stirring occasionally. After 3 hours, stir in the potatoes and season with salt, meat tenderizer, black pepper, and garlic powder. Cook for 2 more hours on High, stirring occasionally. Remove turkey legs and cut the meat off the bones; chop the meat, and return to the cooker. Cook for 1 more hour on High. About 25 minutes before serving time, bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve the turkey and sauce over the hot cooked rice. A very comforting and hearty slow cooker meal over rice. This was a big hit with my husband, and of course very easy since it is made in that trusty slow cooker! :)
Press carrots and oranges through a juicer and into a large glass. This quick, fresh, and delicious juice is  one of my favorite morning drinks!

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place the torn-up bread into a large bowl, and mix with the egg. Lightly mix in the ground chuck, ground sirloin, onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, steak seasoning sauce, hot sauce, and salt and pepper. Form the meat mixture into 6 large patties, 6 inches across by 1 inch thick. Place the burgers on the preheated grill, and cook 10 to 15 minutes per side, until the burgers are browned and no longer pink in the middle. Brush each burger with barbecue sauce, flip them and grill for 5 minutes to slightly char the sauce. Brush the other sides with sauce, flip, and grill for 5 more minutes to cook the other side. These burgers got their name from their colossal size. They are absolutely delicious! My family makes them at almost every game day cookout. Top with desired toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheese, onion, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, if desired) and serve on sesame buns.  
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking pan. Whisk together cornmeal, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Stir in milk and vegetable oil until well blended.

Place each flattened biscuit in a muffin cup; press into bottom and up sides of muffin cup. Set aside for biscuit to settle and slightly rise, about 5 minutes. Lightly press biscuits into cups as needed. Spoon 1 tablespoon pizza sauce into each biscuit; top each with 1 slice pepperoni and 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until biscuit is lightly browned and cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Remove each pizza from tin and place on a cooling rack, about 5 minutes. Super easy mini pizzas - delicious and done in 20 minutes or less!
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan in a separate bowl, set aside. Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides. Dip flour coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to breadcrumb mixture, pressing the crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Set aside breaded chicken breasts for about 15 minutes. Heat 1 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken until golden, about 2 minutes on each side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. Place chicken in a baking dish and top each breast with about 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese on top and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly, and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). My version of chicken parmesan is a little different than what they do in the restaurants, with less sauce and a crispier crust.
Place celery root, 1/2 of the lemon juice, and kosher salt in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain. Blend celery root, cream, and butter in a blender until smooth. Push puree into a bowl through a fine-mesh strainer with a wooden spoon or spatula until puree is completely smooth. Drizzle remaining lemon juice into puree and season with salt and cayenne pepper. I joke that celery root tastes like celery if celery actually tasted good; for the most part, this is true. The flavor is quite mild and pleasant, and the texture is somewhat similar to mashed potatoes. This simple puree is a very versatile side dish, but the tasty root will also work sliced thin and layered in a gratin, either with or without potatoes. I hope you give this great fall and winter vegetable a try soon.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat a 13x9-inch baking dish with 1/4 cup melted butter.

Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Gradually add dry ingredients to moist ingredients, alternating with sour milk, to make a smooth batter. Stir rhubarb into batter. Pour half the batter into prepared cake pan. Stir brown sugar, 1/3 cup white sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and walnuts together in a bowl; sprinkle nut mixture over batter. Pour remaining batter over nut mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a serving platter. Stir 2 teaspoons white sugar with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and sprinkle sugar mixture on top of cake. This is a superb cake that I make for brunches, or whenever I have fresh rhubarb on hand.  Makes a lovely presentation, too!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat 1/2 cup milk and egg yolk together in a bowl. Combine flour and salt in a separate bowl. Cut butter into flour mixture using a pastry blender or fork until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir into milk-egg mixture until a ball of pastry dough forms. Separate dough into 2 pieces. Roll 1/2 of the dough on a floured work surface large enough to fit in the bottom and up the sides of a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan. Place dough on pan. Sprinkle crushed corn flakes over dough. Drain 1/3 cup liquid from each can of cherry pie filling and reserve liquid for another use. Carefully spoon cherries over corn flakes layer.

The strips of chicken and vegetables should be no longer than about 6 inches to leave an inch margin open on the sides of the wrappers for tucking. Soak a rice paper wrapper in cold water just until it becomes flexible, 1 minute or less. Place on slightly damp towel. Place some baby greens near the bottom of the round. Top with strips of chicken and pepper, leaving about an inch margin on the sides. Roll tightly just until the bottom edge meets the center of the paper and sticks there. Then continue to add more chicken strips and vegetable strips. Finish with torn pieces of herbs. Complete the roll, pressing the ingredients to keep roll tight and tucking in the sides. Transfer completed rolls to a plate lined with damp paper towels. Cover each roll with damp papers towels as you work to prevent them from drying out; don't let the rolls touch each other or they will stick together. I love the 'authentic ' spring rolls I so often order at my friendly, neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant. But in this recipe, I'm showing a technique and you can fill the rolls with whatever you have on hand. You should be able to get rice paper wrappers at any large grocery store with an Asian food section but if not, they're easily found online.

Repeat with remaining snapper fillet, seasoning, and lime juice in a second baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until fish is flaky and no longer translucent, 15 to 20 minutes. I like red snapper for this, but any white, flaky fish will work. By the way, many Veracruz-style fish recipes call for pickled jalapenos, but I think there's plenty of acidity in this from the lime and tomatoes, so I like the fresh pepper a little more.

Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. To Make Filling: Crumble ground beef into a large skillet and saute over medium heat for 1 minute. Add onion and garlic. Continue to saute until onion is browned, about 10 minutes. Drain grease from mixture. Sprinkle beef mixture with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 cup flour. Stir in pickle liquid, milk, pickles, and 1 cup shredded cheese. Spoon mixture into pastry shell. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Sprinkle top with remaining 1 cup cheese and bake an additional 5 minutes, until pastry is golden brown and cheese is bubbly. For those nights when you want to try something new.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts in a single layer in the center of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour green beans into one side of the baking dish. Spread potatoes out on the other side of the dish. Sprinkle dressing mix over chicken, beans, and potatoes; drizzle butter over the top. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Quick and easy!
Whisk vegetable oil, vinegar, peanut butter, honey, ginger, chili sauce, soy sauce, and sesame oil together in a bowl until dressing is smooth and creamy. Toss yuba strips, cilantro, carrots, cabbage, and green onions together in a bowl. Pour about 1/2 of the dressing over the salad and stir to coat. Stir remaining dressing into salad until salad is dressed to your liking; top with black sesame seeds. So many things are touted as 'miracle foods' these days, but invariably you find out the claims were false and the benefits exaggerated. I sure hope that doesn't turn out to be the case with these grain-free, gluten-free, dairy-free, low-carb, low-cal, and quite delicious yuba noodles. So what's the catch? It's tofu.
Combine milk, lime juice, lemon juice, and food coloring.  This mixture will thicken. Whip the cream until stiff.  Fold into lime mixture.  Pour into pie shell.  Chill. Easy pie!  You can substitute a prepared shortbread or graham cracker crust for the pastry crust, if you like.

Pour 1/3 of the batter into the prepared tube pan. Swirl 1/2 of the cranberry sauce into the batter. Repeat, ending with the batter on top. Bake 55 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. This old family recipe is delicious for breakfast on Thanksgiving day, or to eat while watching the parade! Plain yogurt can be substituted for sour cream.
In a large pot over medium heat, cook beef until brown; drain. Return meat to pot with pinto beans, kidney beans, diced tomatoes with green chiles, Italian-style diced tomatoes, tomato juice, water, coleslaw mix and Greek seasoning.  Simmer over low heat 1 hour. This is an incredibly easy and quick soup that is awesome.  It will really warm you up on a cold day.  My family loves it.  Try substituting ground turkey for the beef, too!
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat.  Stir in the lobster, onion, celery, carrot, thyme, parsley, peppercorns, seasoned salt, bay leaf, and lemon juice.

Lightly mix in lobster tail meat, green peas, and cooked pasta shells until heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour pasta mixture into prepared casserole dish; top with panko crumbs and Parmesan cheese. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of melted margarine over the casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until topping is brown and crisp, 40 minutes. One Halloween I decided to try out a macaroni and cheese recipe using pumpkin, and it turned out to be a huge hit. The combination of the cheeses and the pumpkin made it so very rich and creamy. The next time I decided to make this dish I added some cooked lobster I had left over, and from there I just fell in love. I have had lobster macaroni and cheese dishes before, but never anything like this. All of this may sound strange and unusual but once you try this dish you will never get it out of your head. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with fresh bread or dinner rolls.
Dissolve yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar in 1/2 cup warm water in a bowl; let stand until mixture is foaming, about 10 minutes.

Serve sushi with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger.
Whisk together the soy sauce, olive oil, brown sugar, lemon pepper, and garlic in a shallow dish; lay the salmon fillets into the mixture with the skin side facing up. Allow to marinate in the refrigerator 4 to 8 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Remove salmon from the marinade and arrange on a baking sheet. Discard the marinade. Cook the salmon under the broiler until lightly browned and the flesh flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 10 minutes. Allow the salmon to rest 5 minutes before slicing and serving. This salmon is so easy, you won't believe how delicious it is. I serve it with rice prepared with chicken broth and a little onion instead of plain water and buttery steamed broccoli with sliced almonds.
Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season chicken breasts on both sides with pepper and onion powder, and arrange in the skillet. Cook 2 minutes on each side, just until browned. Pour tomatoes and reserved liquid over the chicken. Pour in broth. Cover skillet, and continue cooking 15 minutes on each side, until chicken juices run clear. While the chicken is cooking, place the frozen mixed vegetables and water in a pot. Scoop about 3/4 cup liquid from the skillet, and mix into the pot. Bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender; drain. Arrange chicken breasts over the vegetables, and drizzle with liquid from the skillet to serve. This is a light, juicy, flavorful dish. Being a mom of a 7 month old, I've learned to take a lot of shortcuts and still be able to cook quality food. This is quick, easy, and tasty. If you absolutely must use fresh veggies, that's ok, but frozen veggies, in my opinion, work a little bit better. Serve with rice, if desired. To kick it up a bit, add chopped green peppers in with the tomatoes.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove and wash outer leaves from cabbage; line a 13x9-inch baking dish with the leaves to cover the bottom entirely. Shred remaining cabbage. Mix shredded cabbage, potatoes, and smoked sausage in a bowl; spread atop the cabbage leaves in the baking dish. Whisk milk, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; add bread cubes. Set aside until bread absorbs some liquid, 1 to 2 minutes; pour over the cabbage mixture. Top with butter slices. Bake in preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and the top is lightly browned, about 45 minutes. Hearty and delicious but simple Mennonite main dish. Tender cabbage shreds, diced potatoes, and savory kielbasa bake together in a creamy casserole.
Place the chicken carcass into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Drain, and rinse the carcass under running water. Return the carcass to the pot along with the galangal, lime leaves, lemon grass, chile peppers, garlic, and shallot. Pour in 10 cups of water. Return to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer uncovered for 1 1/2 hours, skimming the foam and fat often. Strain through cheesecloth before using.

Pour the yeast batter over this and carefully turn the mixture over with a spatula to blend, just until all flour is moistened. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or up to four days. Turn dough out  onto a floured surface; press into compact balls and knead about 6 turns to release air bubbles. Divide dough into four equal parts. Shape one at a time. Refrigerate the remaining dough. Roll one part of the dough on a floured board into a circle 17 inches in diameter. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the circle into eight equal pie-shaped wedges. Roll the wedges loosely toward the point. Shape each roll into a crescent and place on an ungreased baking sheet. Allow 1 1/2 inches space between each roll. Cover and let rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size. Approximately 2 hours. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Brush croissants with beaten egg. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, until golden.

In a bowl, mix the tomato sauce, reserved cabbage water, white vinegar, and white sugar. Pour the tomato sauce mixture over the cabbage rolls. Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until the ground beef mixture is no longer pink in the center, about 2 1/2 hours. Baste stuffed cabbage rolls every hour. Halupki, also known as stuffed cabbage on the Russian/Ukranian side of my family, is a dish made of rice, beef, and pork encased in cabbage drizzled with a thin, sweet tomato sauce. My grandma Eugenia is 98 and she taught me how to make this comfort food classic. Every family has their own twist on this traditional dish. I hope you enjoy these with mashed potatoes just as we always do in my family!
In a large bowl combine mushrooms, olives, artichoke hearts, hearts of palm and baby corn. In a small bowl combine olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper, parsley and basil.

In a large bowl, combine gelatin and sugar. Stir in boiling water until mixture is dissolved. Stir in pineapple juice and lemon juice concentrate. Divide into 2 containers, and freeze until solid. To serve, place gelatin mixture in punch bowl, and chop into pieces. Pour in ginger ale. This is the best punch I have ever tasted and is requested at every shower and wedding that takes place in our family and at our church.
Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender and golden brown. Stir in garlic. Mix in Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, molasses, and mustard. Cook and stir 5 minutes, then mix in ketchup, cold water, and cornstarch. Reduce heat to low, and continue cooking 10 minutes, until thickened. This sauce can be used as a marinade for beef, pork, or chicken.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream the butter, margarine and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the vanilla. Add the flour and mix until just blended. Do not overmix. Roll dough into 1 inch balls. Place cookies 2 inches apart into prepared cookie sheets. Make a slight indentation in the center. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Cookies should be lightly browned. Cool slightly and frost the center of each cookie. To make the icing, combine the confectioners' sugar, cocoa and vanilla in a small bowl. Stir in the hot water 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. Drizzle the icing from the tip of a knife or spoon onto the center of each cookie. Allow the cookies time to set up before serving. These are a delicate nutty butter cookie with a chocolate filled center. My aunt used to make these, and I loved them.
In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese and milk until well blended. Season with mustard powder and cayenne pepper, then mix in dried cranberries. Use immediately, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. This zesty spread is a holiday hit!  It's easy to make and tastes even better the day after you make it. Serve with crackers or slices of baguette. This spread is zippy, so if you don't like spice, reduce cayenne and dry mustard by half.
In a 2 quart saucepan, combine  sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Slowly stir in milk. Bring to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, over medium heat until mixture thickens. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Stir in vanilla. Pour hot pudding into dessert glasses or molds that have been rinsed in cold water. Chill until firm. Unmold if desired. Serve.

Add spinach and stir until spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle individual servings with Parmesan cheese. Tonight, I was desperate to use up the chicken and fresh spinach in my fridge. I didn't have much energy or time and I couldn't find anything I wanted to make. I took a chance and threw this together from what I had on hand and it turned out great! It can be as simple or as fancy as you want. My picky 5-year olds and husband enjoyed it (except the spinach), so that pretty much makes it a keeper.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a loaf pan. Mash thawed raspberries in a bowl with a fork; press raspberries through a sieve to remove seeds. Mash banana in another bowl with a fork. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl. Beat sugar, eggs, raspberries, banana, and vegetable oil in a bowl with an electric mixer set on low until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir flour mixture into raspberry mixture until batter is just moistened; stir in lemon extract. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. This is a tasty, flavorful quick bread that is very easy to make. It is great with a good cup of coffee!
Pour vodka, gin, ice cubes, sherry, and water into a glass container and freeze until mix is slushy, at least 3 hours. At the same time, freeze martini glasses. Pour martinis into glasses, straining out any remaining ice cubes. The US Marine Corps was founded in Philadelphia on Nov. 10, 1775 in a tavern during the American Revolutionary War. The name of the tavern was 'Tun Tavern.' There is an exact replica of Tun Tavern at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. It was at Quantico in this Tun Tavern that the US Marine Corps Martini was born over 50 years ago. It has been made and served all over the world. Is it a killer martini? More on that later. It is sometimes referred to as the 5-4-3-2-1 Martini. To your health and good cheer! 'Freedom is not free, but the U.S. Marine Corps will pay most of your share.'
Fill a small saucepan with one inch of water. Bring to a boil, add peas, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain and set aside. Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.

Gradually stir in cream, and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Cook, stirring until smooth and thick. Stir in peas, and remove from heat. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving. This is an great side with mashed potatoes and chicken!  Company loves this one and so does my husband.  Not the boring everyday plain peas.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the mint leaves and fry until slightly wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a skillet (or a kadhai, if you have one). Add the red chile peppers, black lentils, coriander seed, chana dal, and mustard seed; cook in the hot oil until the lentils brown and the seeds start to splatter; remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Grind the mixture into a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle; add the mint leaves, tamarind paste, and salt; continue crushing until the mint is completely integrated. This is a south-Indian style fresh chutney that is best eaten with rice and ghee. It would also serve as a great accompaniment to dosas.

This layered dip is always a hit at parties. Serve cold with tortilla chips or crackers.
Use a knife to perforate the acorn squash with several slits. Cook in microwave for 10 minutes. Scrape the flesh into a bowl. Stir in the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, egg, and whole wheat flour. Add the white flour in small amounts and mix until you get a sticky dough with a manageable texture. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll into thin ropes. Slice the dough into quarter-sized gnocchi. Bring the water with 1 tablespoon salt to a boil in a large pot; add the gnocchi to the boiling water one at a time, until they are all floating at the top; remove with a slotted spoon to a large bowl; set aside. Discard all but 1 1/2 cups of the water from the pot and return to heat; add the bouillon cube, beer, sage, and pepper and bring to a boil; continue to boil until the mixture reduces to about half its original volume, about 15 minutes; reduce heat to medium. Whisk the butter cubes into the mixture, one at a time, until they are all melted into the liquid; immediately return the gnocchi to the mixture, turn off the heat, and stir in the Parmesan cheese. Cover the pot and allow to sit for 10 minutes before serving. Acorn squash isn't my favorite autumn squash, so when my husband brought it home from the market, I had to find a creative way to eat it. This recipe is outstanding with the Parmesan sage sauce.
Cover the ribs with cold water, refrigerate, and soak for 1 hour. Drain the ribs, place in a saucepan with 4 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Cook the ribs for 10 minutes, drain, and reserve 2 cups of liquid. Place the ribs and the reserved liquid in a large pot. Mix together the soy sauce, garlic, onion, rice wine, and brown sugar in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved. Pour the mixture over the ribs and broth. Stir to combine, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours. Mix in the carrots, potatoes, shiitake mushrooms, corn syrup, sesame oil, chestnuts, and dates, and simmer until the meat and vegetables are very tender, about 1 more hour. Remove the beef and vegetables to a serving dish, and reduce the liquid in the pot to make a thickened gravy. Pour the sauce over the ribs and vegetables, sprinkle with sliced green onion, and serve. This is the ultimate Korean comfort food. Sugar, corn syrup, and soy sauce can be adjusted to taste. The trick to tender ribs is a looong cooking time. Feel free to let it stew longer. Some versions in Korea also add chestnuts or dates to the stew.
Butter an 8x8x2 inch square pan. Set aside. In a 2 quart saucepan with a candy thermometer inserted, cook sugar, light corn syrup, milk, and salt, until thermometer reads 234 degrees F (112 degrees C).

Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 5 minutes; drain. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet. Cook the hot dog pieces in the butter until browned. Add the hot dogs to the drained noodles with 2 tablespoons butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese; stir until butter is melted and the hot dogs are coated. My mother used to make this for me when I was a kid and I couldn't get enough. It's just buttered egg noodles with parsley, parmesan cheese, and hot dogs. To this day I still eat it and I guarantee that your kids will love it too.

Add dates, ground almonds and cheese, then toss to mix. Add salt, black and white pepper, cloves, ginger, mace and cinnamon. Mix spices in. Don't worry if the filling seems wet, it will thicken as it cooks. Pour filling into pie shell. Cover with top shell and crimp to seal edges. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes to an hour. This is a kind of meat pie that would have been eaten during the Middle Ages (700-1450) in Europe. Feel free to play around with the spices and substitute things such as cardamom, allspice, nutmeg, etc. Use a Whole wheat crust to be really authentic.
Blend kiwi, pineapple, grapes, mango, and water in a blender until smooth. Add spinach and blend again until spinach is completely integrated. Add ice and blend until ice is completely integrated. This is a green smoothie that I created for the September challenge of BlackWomenLosingWeight.com. Makes about 16 ounces! Prep time depends on whether the mango and kiwi are already peeled and sliced.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix ground beef, chives, salt, Worcestershire sauce, and ground mustard thoroughly in a bowl; divide in fourths and make 4 thick oval-shaped burgers. Top each burger with a slice of sharp Cheddar cheese and about 2 tablespoons of chopped sweet onion. Poke 2 holes in the long ends of each burger with your fingers for the heads and tails. Insert half a hot dog into the head and tail holes, letting the rounded ends of the hot dogs poke out about 1 1/2 inches. Press to secure. Poke 2 more holes on each side of the burger and insert 2 more hot dog halves on each side for legs. Cut 2 small slits, about 3/4 inch long, into the ends of the legs to make toes. Repeat with remaining ground beef, hot dogs, cheese slices, and onion to make 4 turtle burgers topped with cheese and onion. If desired, cut tails to small sharp points for more realism. Place 3 halved bacon slices onto a work surface, sides touching. Weave 3 more bacon slices into the first ones, facing 90 degrees to the first slices, to make a woven bacon piece; lay the woven bacon onto a burger, arranging bacon between heads, legs, and tails. Secure with toothpicks. Repeat with remaining bacon to make 3 more woven bacon pieces and cover remaining burgers with bacon. Place a baking rack into a large roasting pan; lay the bacon-wrapped turtle burgers onto the rack and cover lightly with foil. Bake in the preheated oven until the burgers are no longer pink in the middle and hot dog ends are browned, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a burger should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). This is a GREAT kids' favorite, whether BBQ, frying or oven prepared. This recipe fits for all flavors of hot dogs and hamburger meat. If you make smaller hamburger patties, you can put them in hamburger buns to eat. BBQ grilling works also.

Pour about 1/4 cup batter per crepe (depending on the size of your pan) into the hot skillet and immediately tilt and swirl the pan to evenly distribute batter along the bottom. Cook until the center is set and edges begin to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle 1/4 of the filling in the middle of each crepe and sprinkle each with 3 tablespoons Gruyere cheese. Reserve remaining Gruyere cheese. Fold the crepes in thirds over the filling, forming triangle shapes. Serve crepes with remaining Gruyere cheese sprinkled on top. At 611 Supreme in Seattle, authentic French crepes are filled with either savory or sweet fillings. In this recipe, a buckwheat crepe is filled with mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and Gruyere cheese.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook venison, onion and garlic in oil until meat is browned.  Transfer to a slow cooker and stir together with chiles, beans, broth oregano, cumin, salt and paprika.  Cook on medium 4 to 5 hours.

In a medium sauce pan, mix together sugar, peanut butter, and corn syrup. Be careful not to let it burn, or it will ruin the recipe.  Stir mixture until well melted.  Remove pan from heat. Combine warm peanut butter mixture with crisp rice cereal. Grease well a 9 x 13 inch pan with butter or margarine.  Spread mixture in pan.  Allow to cool.  When mixture is no longer sticky to the touch, cut into bars. My aunt used to make these when I was a little girl.  I think they are a nice change from marshmallow treats.
In a blender, combine rum, coffee liqueur and ice cream. Insert ice cubes until volume reaches 5 cups. Blend until smooth. Pour into chilled glasses, and serve. I serve this as a summer after dinner drink or for a cool and  refreshing afternoon cocktail. It's equally tasty with chocolate ice cream!

Tightly pinch edges together tightly seal the cheese within the meat. Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties. Preheat a cast-iron or other heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat. Cook burgers until well browned, about 4 minutes. It is common for burgers to puff up due to steam from the melting cheese. Turn burgers and prick the top of each to allow steam to escape; cook until browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside; about 4 minutes. Serve on hamburger buns. A favorite of Minnesotans! The famous Juicy Lucy! Mmmm. So good. You MUST use American cheese on this to achieve the juiciness in the middle! I like sauteed mushrooms and onions on mine!

Mix buttermilk and reduced apple cider into creamed butter mixture. Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Slowly stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture just until dough is combined. Turn dough onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper. Sprinkle dough with flour and roll to 1/2-inch thickness, adding more flour if dough is sticky. Cut dough into doughnuts using a 3-inch-wide doughnut cutter and arrange on a baking sheet; refrigerate until chilled, 20 to 30 minutes. Heat at least 3 inches of oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons apple cider together in a bowl until glaze is smooth.

Heat a large skillet over high heat. Once hot, lie the watermelon into the pan with the rind along the edge of the pan, leaving one half the the cooking surface free. Crack eggs into the free space in the skillet. Top the eggs with 1/4 of the Parmesan cheese. Cook until the egg white begins to solidify on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Begin folding the solid egg white over the translucent egg white. Continue cooking until the egg can be tilted with the edge of a spatula without the top part of it sliding away from the cooked egg white and is lightly crisped on the bottom, about 2 minutes more.  Flip both the eggs and the watermelon pieces; sprinkle another 1/4 of the Parmesan cheese over the eggs and another 1/4 of the Parmesan over the watermelon pieces. Continue cooking until the egg whites are crisp on the underside, but the yolk remains soft when pressed lightly with the back of a spatula, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove eggs to a plate. Continue cooking watermelon until darkened on the underside, about 1 minute more. Flip watermelon pieces again, top with remaining Parmesan cheese, and remove to the plate with the eggs. Sear ham slices in any remaining liquid in the skillet just until lightly browned and heated through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate next to the watermelon and eggs. Eggs over-easy and pan-grilled watermelon, flavored with fresh parmesan cheese. On its own, with the meat, Eggs Machiavellian is very good for brunch.

Wrap one slice of prosciutto around each asparagus spear, starting at the bottom, and spiraling up to the tip. Place the wrapped spears on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove, and shake the pan back and forth to roll the spears over. Return to the oven for another 5 minutes, or until asparagus is tender, and prosciutto is crisp.  Serve immediately. Extremely easy and elegant appetizer. Asparagus spears are wrapped in a sheath of prosciutto, then baked until crispy. A great dish to make ahead, and bake just before serving.
Grease a 6-donut pan with coconut oil and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Sift together all the flour ingredients: rice, garbanzo, potato starch, arrowroot, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum and salt. Whisk together in a bowl and set aside. In a medium pot, add in milk and coconut oil and allow to warm over low heat until the coconut oil melts (do not allow to boil). Mix gently with a wooden spoon while it's warming. Once the coconut oil is melted, remove from heat and add in the sugar. Stir together to allow the sugar to dissolve completely. Add in apple sauce and vanilla extract and stir to combine. Pour the liquid mixture into the dry ingredients and mix gently to combine together well. (If clumps still develop, you can use an immersion blender and mix the batter for a few minutes until you see a very smooth consistency in the batter.) Add in coconut flakes and mix with a wooden spoon to combine. Pour into pre-greased donut pan and fill about halfway to allow for rising of the batter. Bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees F. Remove from the oven and allow to cool 15 to 30 minutes. Gently scrape the sides of each well and flip the pan over to remove. You can use a toothpick to help the donuts lift out of the pan. To coat the donuts in coconut flakes: Make a glaze by adding the powdered sugar into a small bowl and adding in 1 tablespoon at a time of hot water. Mix well to combine. Coat the donuts thinly with the glaze and drop onto a plate with coconut flakes to coat all over. Makes 6-8 donuts. These oven-baked homemade doughnuts are sugar glazed then dusted with coconut flakes.
Heat olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat, stir in onion. Cook and stir until golden brown, about 12 minutes; season with salt, black pepper, dried basil, dried oregano, and dried thyme. Cook until dried herbs are fragrant, about 1 more minute, then mix in the tomatoes and vermouth. Bring to a boil, then stir in the chicken broth. Bring soup back to a boil, and reduce heat to a simmer. Mix in the fresh basil, oregano, thyme, and garlic. Cover pot, and cook until tomatoes are tender, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle cinnamon over the soup, and ladle into bowls; top each serving with a spoonful of crumbled Gorgonzola cheese. Exotic spices and flavors of fresh tomatoes from the garden blend with onions, garlic, fresh herbs, dry vermouth and Gorgonzola cheese to present a gourmet soup to serve in an hour. Fills the kitchen with aromas of herbs and spices as it simmers. Serve with French bread or other crusty breads; just add a tossed salad with a mild balsamic vinegar and olive oil and a sprinkle of onion salt and pinch of sugar.
Cook and stir ground beef in large pot over high heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, water, carrot, onion soup mix, granulated garlic, oregano, basil, and thyme. Bring to a boil. Turn sauce down to a simmer and cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. When sauce has finished cooking, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta stirring occasionally, until cooked but is still firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Serve Bolognese sauce over hot spaghetti. Time saving and budget friendly recipe even my picky 4 year old enjoys! The sauce can also be simmered in a slow cooker.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 12 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. Whisk almond meal, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl; add blueberries and stir to coat. Make a well in the center of the blueberry mixture; pour applesauce, almond milk, honey, and coconut oil into well and stir until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. After developing an egg and dairy allergy, these are a good option. Sprinkle tops with sugar and cinnamon if you want a little extra sweetness.
Beat cream in medium bowl until stiff peaks form. Stir together curd, cream cheese and almond extract in small bowl until smooth. Stir curd mixture into whipped cream until blended. Divide mousse into tall stemmed glasses. Divide berries among glasses and garnish with mint, if desired. Refrigerate until serving. A light and lovely mousse flavored with lemon is topped with fresh berries and an optional mint garnish. Serve it in tall stemmed glasses for an elegant finish.
In the microwave, or in a saucepan over medium heat, melt caramel, stirring frequently until smooth. Stir in the crispy rice cereal and peanuts. Spread the mixture out to an even thickness onto a buttered baking sheet. Set aside to cool. In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt chocolate chips, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat. Spread over the cooled caramel slab.

Drizzle dressing over the cabbage mixture and toss to coat. Adding a little orange juice to make the dressing a little sweeter. This recipe easily makes enough for 10 people or more. If it's on the thin side, add another 1/2 cup of mayonnaise. If it's too thick, thin with more orange juice.
Stir crushed chocolate wafer crumbs, 1/4 cup white sugar, and softened butter together in a bowl. Press into an 8-inch pie plate. Refrigerate until set, at least 15 minutes. Pour water into a bowl and sprinkle gelatin over the top; let sit until gelatin softens, 5 to 10 minutes. Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until bubbling. Beat egg yolks and 1/2 cup white sugar together in a bowl. Pour hot milk into egg yolk mixture in a steady stream, whisking constantly. Return egg mixture to saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens slightly, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir gelatin mixture into egg-yolk mixture until gelatin melts and custard is well-combined; cool to room temperature. Stir in peppermint extract and vanilla extract. Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form sharp peaks. Beat heavy cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl until medium-soft peaks form. Fold egg whites and whipped cream into custard. Pour custard into prepared crust. Sprinkle with crushed peppermint candy and grated chocolate. Chill pie in the refrigerator until set, 8 hours to overnight. Perfect combination of chocolate and mint in a beautiful presentation for Christmas.
To make sponge, warm a small bowl by rinsing it with hot water. Pour in warm water and sprinkle 1 package yeast on it. Let stand until yeast has dissolved. Stir in 1/2 cup flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 30 minutes, or until doubled. Sprinkle remaining yeast over warm milk. Let stand until dissolved. Beat together sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla. Stir in milk-yeast mixture. Add sponge and stir until well incorporated. Combine butter and remaining 3 1/2 cups flour until crumbly. Slowly pour in egg mixture and beat on high speed 3 to 4 minutes, until dough is elastic looking and long strands form. Beat in fruit and zests. Turn dough into oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 2 to 3 hours. Fold down bags to form a 3-inch cuff. Brush inside and out with melted butter. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead a few times to deflate. Divide dough into 3 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and drop into prepared bags. Place bags on a baking sheet about 4-inches apart and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm place until doubled again, about 2 hours. Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut an X in top of each loaf with oiled scissors. Combine egg yolk with cream. Brush tops of loaves lightly with egg wash. Place baking sheet in bottom 1/3 of oven. After 10 minutes, lower heat to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C). Bake for 30 more minutes; if tops get too brown, cover with foil. Loaves are done when a wooden skewer inserted into centers comes out clean. Cool on wire rack. This is the Italian answer to fruitcake. A lovely textured, citrus infused  fruitcake or bread that will satiate an appetite for something sweet and delicate to accompany  tea or coffee. For this recipe you will need 3 (3 1/4x7 inch baking-safe paper bags. Be sure to use paper bags that are intended for baking. The lunch bags sold in most grocery stores are unsafe to use!
Dissolve sugar in rum, brandy and vanilla extract in a large, heavy pitcher. Add milk; freeze until very cold or even slushy, about 4 to 8 hours. (Can be frozen for a month.) Pour into glasses, grate nutmeg over each glass, if desired, and serve. Homemade eggnog is rich, extravagant, irresistible. But the ingredients - heavy cream, raw eggs, sugar and booze - give one pause. A few years back, I discovered a delicious high-flavor, no-risk alternative: milk punch, made with whole milk (no cream, no eggs). And it's easy to make. No cooking, no whipping egg whites and cream: Just mix and freeze. Make a pitcher today, and stick it in the freezer for the season. The spirits keep the milk from freezing; the freezer keeps the milk from spoiling. But remember, it's potent - one of my friends calls it 'the adult milkshake'!
Combine the salt, sage and black pepper in a small bowl and rub on both sides of the chops. Melt the butter or margarine in a large skillet over medium high heat and saute the chops for 5 minutes per side, or until well browned. Meanwhile, in a separate small saucepan over high heat, combine the water and the bouillon and stir until bouillon dissolves. Add this to the chops, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer chops for 45 minutes. These chops are so easy to make, but they taste like you've slaved over them for hours! Serve with roasted red potatoes and vegetables, if desired.
Spread hummus onto sandwich wrap. Arrange artichoke hearts and red bell pepper pieces atop the hummus. Scatter mozzarella cheese over artichokes and bell pepper; top with spinach. Roll the sandwich wrap around the ingredients to serve. Very easy to make wraps. Can be made individually as a meal for one person or make multiples, cut into sections, and serve as an appetizer.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat, add lobster, and gently reheat until hot. Season with seafood seasoning, then transfer to a serving dish. Toss with tomato, avocado, and lettuce. Sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese. This is a cold salad that may be served as a first course or as a main dish.
Combine cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, capers and basil, mixing well. Spread 1 teaspoon cheese mixture over center of each slice of salami. Place one tomato in center of cheese. Gather up salami around cheese and tomato, forming a rosette and pressing lightly to hold shape. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours before serving to guests. Creamy cheese and tangy capers combine with the robust flavor of Margherita® Genoa salami and a hint of fresh basil for a sensational starter.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray. Rinse cod filets and pat dry. Place fish in a single layer in the baking dish. Mix together milk, onion, lemon pepper, parsley and salt; pour over fish filets. Drizzle filets with lemon juice. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes, or until fish is firm and can be flaked with a fork. Easy to prepare and very tasty!  A simple recipe for fish baked in milk with almost no fat! You may use your favorite variety of white fish.
Place the spinach, orange sections, sliced fennel, fennel fronds, almonds, and mint into a large mixing bowl; set aside. Whisk together the olive oil, orange juice, cumin, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad, and toss gently to dress. Serve immediately. This wonderful, fresh, summery dish, is very easy to make. I'm relatively new to fennel, but this recipe definitely highlights the wonderful, licorice-y flavor and complements it well with the citrus. This would be a great choice to accompany a fish or chicken dish.
Cut ribs into serving size pieces and place in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a medium saucepan saute onion, garlic and mushrooms in oil until tender. Add vinegar, honey, lime juice, mustard, salt, pepper, soy sauce, water and chili sauce and mix together well. Warm mixture throughout. Pour this sauce over the ribs and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour or until ribs are tender and internal temperature has reached 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Baste often with sauce. A honey mustard lime sauce coats these baked ribs. Scrumptious! When determining the number of servings, take into account the fact that most people actually like to have a rack of ribs to themselves. Accordingly, 4 pounds of spareribs might serve 4 or 6 people, depending on the serving size!
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Rinse the pig, and tie the front legs together with heavy string. Tie the back legs together also. Make numerous slits in the skin, and insert slices of butter, followed by cloves of garlic. Generously rub the entire pig with salt first, then the Cajun seasoning, including inside the cavity. Lay strips of bacon across the back and secure to the sides with toothpicks. Place the pig in a large roasting pan and pour in the apple cider. Cover the ears and snout of the pig with aluminum foil to prevent scorching. Roast for 7 hours in the preheated oven, basting every hour or so with the drippings. If the pan begins to dry out, add more cider or water. To serve, remove to a platter, and place the apple in the pig's mouth. Discard the aluminum foil from ears and snout. A new twist on an old holiday favorite. While preparation is best done over a fire-pit, the oven works just as well if you are short on minions to turn and baste or if you happen to reside in the city.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and transfer noodles to the prepared casserole dish; top with chicken, ham, and Swiss cheese. Mix cream of chicken soup, milk, and sour cream together in a bowl; spoon soup mixture over noodle mixture. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in the melted butter until crumbs are coated with butter and cheese, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture over casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and lightly browned, about 30 minutes. Allow casserole to cool for 10 minutes before serving. This is a second version of another member's yummy casserole. It has all the creamy and wonderful flavor of chicken cordon bleu with a little of the fat and hassle removed.
In a large bowl, combine beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Roll into meatballs about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in size. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the meatballs until browned on all sides. In a separate medium bowl, mix together the water, vinegar, ketchup, cornstarch, sugar and soy sauce. Pour over the meatballs, and allow sauce to thicken. Continue to heat until the sauce just starts to bubble. I got this recipe from my mother-in-law shortly after I was married. Now it is a favorite of our kids. I like to serve it over rice.
In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without. The right way to scramble eggs. There is more to just mixing eggs and cooking! This will make a believer out of you.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 2-quart rectangular baking dish with Reynolds Wrap(R) Pan Lining Paper, parchment side up. No need to grease dish.

Arrange the rolled tortillas, seam sides down, in the prepared baking dish. Spoon the remaining tomato mixture over the tortillas. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese. Bake, uncovered, about 20 minutes or until heated through. Give this classic Tex-Mex dish a fresh update by adding butternut squash or sweet potato.
Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir livers in the hot skillet until cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Add olive oil, lemon juice, and salt to livers; gently stir until mixed. Remove skillet from heat and sprinkle garlic over livers. This is the ultimate garlic chicken liver recipe. Simple, quick, minimal ingredients, and low in carbs! The lemon, garlic, and liver flavors blend together to to make a surprisingly mild gourmet dish.
Place the crushed strawberries, minced jalapeno pepper, lemon juice, and pectin into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once simmering, stir in the sugar until dissolved, return to a boil, and cook for 1 minute. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart. Allow to cool overnight Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area. This is a favorite in our family at Christmas.  This jam is not spicy, but can be made to be spicy by adding more peppers or a few habanero peppers.  The flavor of the sweet strawberries combined with the flavor of the peppers gives this jam a wonderful flavor dimension. The strawberries may be frozen (thawed and crushed) and the peppers may be canned (drained and chopped).
Crumble ground beef into a Dutch oven over medium heat. Stir in water, and mash ground beef thoroughly with a potato masher. Stir in tomato sauce, ketchup, salt, pepper, sugar, and chili powder; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; simmer, 60 to 90 minutes, until the sauce reaches a medium consistency that is not too soupy. This is my family's favorite hotdog sauce. It originates from West Virginia. We like it with a bite, but you can adjust it to your taste. We top the hotdogs with ketchup, mustard, the hotdog sauce, and finally some chopped onions...YUM!  This recipe makes enough for freezing and using later.
Combine the pumpkin and creamed corn in a blender; pulse to puree the mixture for 1 minute or until smooth. Add the milk and continue to pulse the mixture for another minute, or until well combined. Pour pumpkin mixture into a 3 to 4 quart saucepan over medium heat. Immediately stir in the broth, apple cider, water, butter, and ground mace. Heat for  15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Salt and pepper to taste. Add thawed corn kernels and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Simple Potlatch fare, comes from the fruits of the earth and sea. Here, pureed pumpkin and canned cream corn simplifies the otherwise tedious preparation, and may be spiced up to your liking or left mellow and earthy.
Mix milk, peanut butter, honey, and brown sugar together in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir, scraping sides and bottom of saucepan with a rubber spatula, until topping is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Tastes like peanut butter fudge. An easy, quick sauce or topping. I just whipped this up one night on a whim and I liked how it turned out. I used evaporated milk because it's what I had on hand, but it turned out to be a good thing! Peanut butter and honey measurements are approximate and were eye-balled. Use your best judgement to get the thickness desired. As long as you don't burn it you really can't go wrong with this. It's very important to keep stirring and not let the bottom burn. Serve warm, poured over ice cream or with a fresh banana on toast.
Wash and drain scallops. If scallops are large, cut in half. In a small stock pot, melt butter over medium-low heat.  Saute onions and mushrooms until tender. Stir in flour. Pour in milk and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Add wine, scallops, salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat until thickened. Serve topped with Swiss cheese and parsley. A wonderful soup featuring white wine, onions and tender scallops. You may use either ocean or bay scallops.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.

Gently mix tuna into sauce. Simmer until zucchini are almost tender, 7 to 10 more minutes. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; stir in elbow macaroni. Cook until still firm, about 7 minutes. Drain well. Mix elbow macaroni into tuna sauce until thoroughly combined. Taste for salt levels and adjust if necessary. Turn off heat, cover pan, and let pasta and sauce stand for exactly 6 minutes and 15 seconds. Pasta will soak up the sauce and become more tender. Serve in bowls and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. This simple pasta dish with tuna and zucchini is incredibly delicious and so easy! It's not fancy, it's just dinner.
In a small bowl, stir together yeast, sugar and hot water; set aside until bubbles form on the yeast's surface. Stir in salt and olive oil. Place flour in a large bowl, then stir in yeast mixture and bring mixture together to form a soft dough. Working on a lightly floured surface, use your hands to knead the dough until it's satiny smooth and soft, about 15 minutes. Cover dough with a clean towel and set aside to rest. Coarsely chop the spinach. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add spinach. Cook spinach 2 minutes, or just until wilted; drain very well and return to the pot. Add onions, lemon juice, garlic, basil, mint, and garlic salt. Cook and stir spinach mixture 2 minutes more to blend the flavors. Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Meanwhile, cut the dough into golf-ball size pieces and roll into 5-inch diameter disks about 1/4-inch thick. Place 1 tablespoon of spinach filling in the middle of each disk. Be sure to stir the spinach mixture frequently so the juice doesn't separate. Fold up three sides of the disk to make a triangle, leaving a small hole in the center to release steam while baking. Bake 10 to15 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove and cool on racks. These delicious, lemony spinach pies are perfect as maza (appetizers), or serve them with other Middle Eastern dishes.
Place the 1-inch piece of ginger and star anise in a pot of water over medium-heat and bring to a boil. Add chicken to the water. Lower heat to medium-low; simmer until chicken is no longer pink the middle, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove to a plate to cool. Once cool to the touch, dice into bite-sized pieces. Make a dressing by whisking together the mayonnaise, salt, pepper, paprika, and honey; set aside. Combine the diced chicken, celery, apple, onion, raisins, walnuts and 2 teaspoons minced ginger in a bowl. Drizzle dressing into the chicken mixture; stir until pieces are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate overnight. My mom really likes the DC Chicken Salad at Corner Bakery, so I came up with a copy that tastes as good as the real thing. Enjoy!
Mix crushed graham crackers with butter or margarine.  Reserve 2 tablespoons of this mixture for the top of the pie.   Press remaining mixture in pie pan.

Then stir, stir, and stir until mixture begins to cool and get creamy. Stir in chopped nuts. Drop by tablespoonfuls onto waxed paper to cool. The most fantastic, EASY candy you can make... sinfully delicious and habit forming.   I have only seen this fail once, and then the disaster was the most marvelous gooey pecan praline ice cream topping.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Thoroughly mix ground lamb, rosemary, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and pepper together in a bowl; shape into 4 patties. Cook the burgers until they are beginning to firm and are hot and slightly pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Alternately, you can cook the burgers to your desired degree of doneness. Rest burgers while assembling toppings. Mix mayonnaise and mustard together in a small bowl; spread 1 tablespoon of the mixture onto one side of each bun. Put a burger onto each bun and top with tomato and greens. Sandwich with remaining bun half to serve. I bought a selection of lamb cuts from a CSA and got several one-pound packages of ground lamb. I made the last one tonight, and it was the best of all.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the ground beef. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain. Stir in the diced tomatoes, ranch-style beans, and garlic salt. Bring to a boil; reduce the heat to low. Layer the sliced potatoes evenly over the ground beef mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Cover; simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. A family favorite, given to me by a friend, quick and easy and delicious. You can add shredded cheese when the potatoes are tender and cook a few more minutes, and the stew is great with sour cream and salad.
Fill a large saucepan with 1/2 inch of water and bring to a boil.  Cook asparagus until tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain, then rinse with cold water.  Return pan to the stove over medium heat, pour in oil, and swirl around pan.  Shake excess water off of the asparagus, and toss in oil with sesame seeds, and salt to reheat. Asparagus is steamed and then tossed with olive oil, kosher salt and toasted sesame seeds.
Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Remove from the pan to drain on paper towels.

In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold the whites into the fruit/nut mixture until no streaks remain. Spoon into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 90 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. This has been a favorite of my husband's since I can long remember.  His mother always manages to bake him one every year (she's 75) for Christmas......though she claims it's always his last.
Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select whole wheat cycle; press Start. If using the delay timer, decrease water by 1 tablespoon. This bread is an excellent way to use some of the grain that is left over when brewing beer. Just make sure that you aren't using spent grain that has hops mixed in with it!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart (8 inch round) casserole dish. In a medium saucepan, bring 1 cup of water to a boil. Stir in instant rice, cover and remove from heat. Let sit for 5 minutes. In a medium skillet over high heat, brown ground beef with onions and green pepper. Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce and chili powder. Simmer for 20 minutes. Stir cooked rice into the beef mixture. Mix in the corn, salt and pepper. Pour the mixture into prepared casserole dish. Cut the American cheese slices in half and place over the top. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly. This beef, veggies and rice casserole is easy to make and a family favorite.
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, baking soda, white sugar, and light brown sugar together in a large bowl. Fold the vanilla extract, eggs, vegetable oil, lemon juice, and zucchini into the flour mixture one ingredient at a time with a rubber spatula; divide the mixture between 2 loaf pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. This recipe is delicious, moist and a great way to use up all the zucchini that your garden produces. Enjoy! Shred the zucchini first and let it sit in a colander to drain while putting the other ingredients together. I use very large zucchini from my garden and cut out all the seeds. Use left over shredded zucchini to make fritters. Optional additions include pecans, walnuts, dried cherries, raisins, or chocolate chips.
Fill a stockpot to half full with water.  Stir Italian seasoning, basil, thyme, liquid smoke, olive oil, salt, and white wine into water.  Squeeze the lemon wedges over the mixture and drop the wedge into the pot. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat; add the artichoke halves and continue to boil until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove artichokes from water and drain upside down on paper towel; allow to cool to the touch. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Lightly coat the cooled artichoke halves with cooking spray. Cook artichoke halves on grill until edges are slightly charred. Drizzle with melted butter to serve. I was inspired to create this recipe by the grilled artichokes at our favorite restaurant. My husband thinks mine are better. Top with mayonnaise instead of butter if you prefer.
Beat cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk with an electric mixer in a bowl until well combined. Stir strawberries and 1 container whipped topping into cream cheese mixture. Spread mixture into the two prepared pie crusts. Top pies with remaining container of whipped topping. Garnish with sliced strawberries if desired. Chill for at least 2 hours. This fabulous pie tastes like a strawberry shake in a crust. This recipe was born of necessity one day when I had to make a dessert for a family gathering and threw something together using only the ingredients I had on hand!
In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar, baking powder, salt and pecans (if desired). In a separate bowl, stir together milk, butter and egg.

Roll date log in the coconut until coated. Cover date log with aluminum foil and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Cut log into 1/4-inch slices. Frying pan cookies - a sweet delight. Great for Christmas!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork chops in the skillet, and top with garlic and onion. Sprinkle with seasoned salt. Cook chops 5 minutes on each side, or until done. Drain grease, and transfer chops to the prepared baking dish. Top each chop with a tomato slice and 2 slices cheese. Cover and bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Garnish with parsley to serve. Seasoned boneless pork chops, topped with fresh tomato slices and melted Monterey Jack cheese, then garnished with fresh parsley.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and line a standard 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners. Whisk the flour(s), oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, ginger, and nutmeg together in a medium bowl. Set aside. With a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or an electric hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together on medium speed for about 3 minutes until a thick paste forms. Scrape the beaters and the bowl. Add the applesauce and eggs and beat on medium-low speed until the sugar paste breaks up and a loose batter forms. Stir in the carrots, walnuts, and coconut. Gently stir in the flour mixture just until it is incorporated--don't over mix. The batter will be very thick. Divide the batter evenly between the 12 muffin cups, mounding it to the brim of each paper liner. Bake for about 25 minutes, until the muffins are browning on top. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. A delicious breakfast treat awaits. This carrot morning glory muffin is a crowd pleaser and you can even make it Gluten Free!

Remove from oven and allow to cool. These frosted pecans are a festive snack for any holiday occasion. This recipe was originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com
Place cucumber, avocado, onion, green bell pepper, mint, yogurt, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic in a blender. Process until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate overnight before serving. Mint makes this a fresh, cool dip or dressing that can be enjoyed on a cracker, tossed in a salad or used for a vegetable dip. Try it spread on a wrap with sliced roast turkey and your favorite cheese.
Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt. Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange onto a large plate so they do not touch. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes. Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings again 15 to 30 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 9 to 12 minutes.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer fried wings to a large stainless steel bowl. Drizzle sauce over the wings and toss to coat. Wonderful Buffalo-style fried chicken wings!
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.

Bake carrot mixture in the preheated oven until slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Mix macaroni, chicken, 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese, Caesar dressing, sweet bell peppers, and Parmesan cheese into carrot mixture; top with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is heated through and cheese is melted, about 25 minutes. I love that this recipe uses the leftover veggies and meat from a party or picnic. It tastes great and is super easy to make.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Cream butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla. In a blender or food processor, process the oats until finely chopped. Add the chopped oats, flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder into the creamed butter and sugar mixture and mix well.  Stir in the chocolate and nuts. Roll dough into 1 1/2 - 2 inch balls (do not press) and place 2 inches apart on a cookie sheet.  Bake for 10 minutes. It's the best chocolate chip, oatmeal cookie I've ever had.  Recipe is large, I cut it in half. 
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the spaghetti at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and set aside. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the garlic and ginger in the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir the kale into the garlic and ginger mixture; continue cooking and stirring 1 minute more. Add the drained spaghetti to the kale mixture; toss while cooking about 30 seconds before adding the soy sauce and water. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Make a well in the middle of the spaghetti mixture. Pour the eggs into the well; gently fold the eggs into the noodle mixture as they cook until they are evenly distributed through the noodles and cooked, about 5 minutes. Season with the crushed red pepper flakes. Drizzle the sesame oil over the noodles to serve. Yummy and super-quick! Depending on dietary needs, you may substitute tofu for the eggs.
Blend yogurt, orange juice, cantaloupe, and ice cubes in a blender until smooth, about 30 seconds. This is a very simple recipe! A sweet, healthy way to start your day with a delicious, unique flavor.
Combine milk, matcha green tea powder, ice, and vanilla syrup, respectively in a blender; blend to desired consistency. Serve with whipped cream on top. Delicious green tea powder blended into a creamy drink that's better than Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino®.

Drop by level tablespoonfuls onto a lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes. Somewhat like a chocolate chip cookie but this one has the added crunch of crisp rice cereal.
In a large pot, bring potatoes, celery and onion to a boil in 2 cups of broth.  Cook until potatoes are tender, 15 minutes.  Drain and reserve liquid. Combine reserved broth and half-and-half in pot.  In a bowl, combine melted butter and flour.  Stir into half-and-half  mixture over medium heat.  Stir until thickened.  Stir in reserved vegetables, remaining broth, bouillon and pepper.  Heat through and serve. This potato soup has more flavor than any potato soup I have ever had.  It is a bit salty due to the bouillon cubes but you can add more milk to dilute if you find it necessary.  For less creamy and lower fat, use whole milk instead of half-and-half  -- still tastes great!
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels and crumble, reserving the drippings in the skillet.

Combine tomato and clam juice cocktail, thawed frozen orange juice concentrate, and lime juice in a large pitcher; mix. Stir the Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and 2 tablespoons salt through the cocktail mixture until the salt has dissolved. Pour 1/4 cup salt for rimming glasses onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rim of a large beer glass with a wedge of lime, dip the moistened rim into the salt. Tap off excess. Fill the rimmed glass with ice. Pour 1/3 to 1/2 cup michelada mix, or to taste, over the ice. Fill the rest of the glass with beer and stir to serve. A Mexican favorite, the michelada is a simple way to make a cheap Mexican beer into a delicious drink that will quickly become a party favorite. I recommend a cheap Mexican beer such as Modelo® or Tecate® for best taste and to stay true to the michelada concept.  Best served at a Mexican food barbecue alongside fajitas, Mexican rice, guacamole, salsa, and so on with family and friends!
Dissolve yeast in warm water.  Allow to stand until mixture is frothy. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and soda.  Add shortening and work until crumbly.  Mix in yeast mixture and buttermilk.  Store, well covered, in a greased bowl in the refrigerator.  Don't worry if it is a little sticky; it will firm up as it chills.  Dough can be stored up to 2 weeks. When ready to make rolls, take out amount needed.  Turn dough out on a lightly floured surface, and knead for 2 or 3 minutes.   Roll out, and cut rolls.  Place in greased muffin cups.  Let rise for 30 minutes. Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) oven for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. These are referred to as fake sourdough biscuits, but are really refrigerator rolls. Very easy to make, and so handy.

Stir the sugar, nutmeg, and self-rising flour together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the milk until no lumps remain. Pour the batter over the melted butter in the baking dish. Do not stir. Spoon the sliced peaches over top; gently pour in the juice. Return to the oven, and bake until the batter has firmed and the cobbler has risen a bit, 35 to 45 minutes. This was the result of letting my 3 baby cousins 'help' me in the kitchen. The oldest was 4. Surprisingly this cobbler turned out pretty well. If a bit messy.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. Cook spinach according to package directions.

Separate dough into 10 biscuits. Press into the bottom and sides of each muffin cup, forming 1/4 inch rims. Sprinkle half of the bacon into the bottoms of the dough-lined muffin cups. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture into each cup. Bake 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until filling is set and rims of the tarts are golden brown. Sprinkle with the remaining bacon, and lightly press into the filling. Remove from pan, and serve warm. Light and flaky, these tarts are easy to make and easy to reheat.

Let cool for at least 10 minutes before cutting into squares. MMMMM...Vegan Brownies!!!!  These are very gooey, which is a good thing in my book. However, if you want your brownies a little more solid you'll need to cook them longer than the recommended time. Great for people with egg or dairy allergies too!
Blend the oatmeal, cottage cheese, and egg whites in a blender until smooth; add water as needed to keep the mixture moving. Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper; blend to combine.

Flip the pancake and cook until browned on the bottom; remove from heat. Spread the mushrooms over one half of the pancake; top the mushrooms with the spinach, Canadian bacon, and feta cheese. Fold the other half of the pancake over the fillings like you would an omelet. Savory veggie-filled pancakes for breakfast or any meal. This is my go-to meal when I come home late and don't feel like cooking. Experiment with other veggie, meat, and cheese combinations.
Stir the vodka, sloe gin, amaretto liqueur, bourbon liqueur, and pineapple juice in a large pitcher or punch bowl; refrigerate until well-chilled. Serve over ice. A good friend introduced me to this simple to make 'adult' drink that really packs a punch! I keep a can of pineapple juice (as well as 1/2 batch of the premixed liquors) in the fridge at all times during the summer, for those impromptu happy hours on the deck. Careful, though, its fruity taste is deceiving and it WILL sneak up on you.

Gradually beat in the milk and vanilla until well mixed, then fold in the egg whites. Sandwich at least 1 tablespoon of filling between the flat sides of two cookies. Chocolate sandwich cookies with cream filling. I use reconstituted powdered egg whites for the filling instead of fresh since they won't be cooked.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Transfer to a serving dish.

Add more marinade as needed. Cover pan and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until meat is tender and the juices run clear. Remove meat to a deep platter, and stir the sour cream into the juices in the pan. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly until gravy is thick and smooth. Pour over meat and serve immediately. I tried this recipe and it was superb!
In a medium bowl, mix together butter, confectioners' sugar, and sweetened condensed milk. Mix in the coconut. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. Melt chocolate and shortening over a double boiler, stirring occasionally until smooth. Remove from heat when melted, and stir to make sure the shortening is fully incorporated. Use toothpicks to hold the balls while dipping in the chocolate. Set on wax paper to dry. These little balls of joy are perfect for any occasion.

Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until the onion is translucent and the apricots are soft, about 10 minutes. Pour the mixture into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the sauce moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth. Pour the blended sauce back into the saucepan, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat.  (You can also use a stick blender and puree the sauce right in the cooking pot.) Stir the chicken meat into the simmering sauce and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, 20 to 30 minutes. A wonderful curry dish made from a base of fresh apricots. Not too spicy, not too mild. Serve over hot cooked jasmine or Basmati rice.

Top with the onion, garlic, and cilantro. Pour enough water into the slow cooker to cover the bottom half of the pork shoulder. Cook on Low until the meat begins to fall apart, 6 to 8 hours. Shred meat with two forks inside the slow cooker before serving. This is not your bbq slow pulled pork. It really shows off the pork! Just a touch of adobo sauce gives the pork a nice smokiness. Pair with fresh condiments and corn tortillas! Super easy to make and oh so tasty. Serve with corn tortillas and your favorite condiments (i.e. lime, avocado, fresh cilantro, corn salsa, and queso fresco).
Whisk together sour cream, mustard, lemon juice and dill until well blended. Chill before serving. This sour cream dill sauce is great over any fish, especially grilled salmon. You may add more lemon or mustard to suit your taste.
Place the paneer cubes in a deep bowl. Pour enough hot water over the paneer to cover; sprinkle the turmeric into the water. Set aside to allow the hot water to soften the paneer. Drain.

Transfer to a medium-high area of the grill and cook pork until it is slightly pink in the center, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Brining pork chops is like upgrading to premium cable; once you do it, you can't go back to basic. Dissolve salt and molasses in water, toss in the chops, and wait. What do you get from such little effort? A pork chop that's seasoned from the inside out, with a firm, but very moist texture.

This recipe is rather strange and surprisingly good! When someone requested this, I thought it would be kind of hard to get the flavors to work, but they do! The bleu cheese lends itself well to the bacon, rosemary, and squash. The carrots add crunch and the onions also go well with the bacon. I would definitely add mushrooms to this!

You don't have to pulverize them, go for pieces about the size of your thumbnail. In one bowl, combine carrot, onion, garlic, and ginger.  In another bowl, green onions and frozen peas. Now drain all the water off the bean curd, fungus and mushrooms. The bean curd might need some tough bits removed, and the remainder cut into quarter-inch rings. The mushrooms only need slicing and the fungus is pre-sliced so no worries there. Combine bean curd and mushrooms in a third bowl. Heat wok over high heat; let the metal get smoking hot, about one minute. Add  three tablespoons of vegetable oil. Wait about 30 seconds, and tip in the bowl of carrot, onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring frequently.  The garlic's going to brown first because it has the highest sugar content, so keep an eye on it, and turn the flame down if necessary. Tip in the  bean curd, shredded fungus, and mushrooms, and cook and stir for one minute. Now look to see that your flame is set to maximum, and tip in the spring onion and the frozen peas. You don't need to cook them, just threaten them. Keep them moving, and mix in the rice. Stir in the eggs, and then season with generous, generous amounts of tamari and sesame oil, and a few twists of fresh black pepper. My husband is Chinese and I am Western.

Cut dough into 8 wedges, and place on prepared baking sheet. To make the scone topping, whisk the milk and 1 egg together in a small bowl. Brush tops of scones with the egg mixture. Sprinkle each scone with cinnamon sugar and almonds. Bake in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, and a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. I especially enjoy these scrumptious scones--bursting with apples, cinnamon and almonds--on a rainy afternoon with a cup of tea. Because they're made with yogurt and no butter, they're a good fit for everyone's palates. Hope you enjoy them, too!

Combine half the flour, yeast, and warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer. Cover and set aside at room temperature until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and the other half of the flour into the flour-water mixture. Knead with the dough hook of the stand mixer until it forms into a smooth, elastic ball that pulls away from the sides, about 10 minutes. Flour your hands, remove the dough and gently form it into a ball. Place back in the bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour 15 minutes. Divide dough into 8 equally-sized pieces, about 3 ounces each. Form each piece into a ball and poke a hole in the center, stretching to create an open and even-sized hole. Place on a floured surface, sprinkle with additional flour, cover with plastic, and let rest for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Sprinkle a baking sheet with cornmeal.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. While pasta is cooking, cook sausage and peppers in large skillet over medium heat until sausage is brown and juices run clear.  Drain sausage mixture and return it to the pan. Pour in the broth, season with black pepper and bring to a boil. Toss pasta with sausage sauce and serve. Yummy dish that is super fast to put together.  My husband loves this dish!  This is great with a tossed salad! Enjoy!
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the potatoes into thick strips like steak fries, and layer them in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons olive oil, and dust with 1 tablespoons of the adobo seasoning.  Arrange the chicken pieces on top of the potatoes. Drizzle the remaining olive oil onto the chicken, and sprinkle the rest of the adobo seasoning. Sprinkle the sliced garlic around the chicken. Bake, uncovered for 1 hour, or until the chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear. If using a meat thermometer, the internal temperature should be 175 degrees F (79 degrees C). If the chicken becomes too dark before it has finished cooking, cover the dish with aluminum foil. Potatoes and chicken are seasoned generously with adobo seasoning and garlic. A good garlic chicken recipe for those of you who love garlic.
Prepare the pudding according to the directions on the box. Spread the pudding in the bottom of the pie shell.  Place the strawberries large side down on to the pudding. Pour the strawberry glaze over the strawberries, covering completely. Cover with whipped topping. This is the best strawberry pie I have ever had. Great taste without a lot of work! Garnish with a few sliced strawberries.
Combine water, vinegar, sugar, red pepper flakes, and garlic in a small saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir until sugar is dissolved and sauce is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Heat a skillet over low heat. Spread butter onto 1 side of each bread slice. Spread cream cheese on the opposite side of 1 of the bread slices. Layer Cheddar cheese and pickles on top of the cream cheese layer. Drizzle 1 to 2 tablespoons sauce on the other slice of bread on the side opposite the butter; place bread on top of pickle layer, butter-side on the outside, creating a sandwich. Cook sandwich in the hot skillet until cheese is melted and bread is browned, about 5 minutes per side. Remove top bread piece, add tomatoes to middle, and close sandwich. The best sandwich I've ever had that is a spin off of a grilled cheese I had at a ski chalet.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Sprinkle ribs with garlic salt and place into a roasting pan. Stir ketchup, vinegar, sugar, celery salt, chili powder, salt, dry mustard, paprika, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour over the ribs. Cook, basting with the pan drippings every half-hour, until the meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 90 minutes. These are some classic ribs that your mother used to make.
Combine flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. Melt 1 cup of chocolate chips over low heat.  Cream butter and sugar.  Add melted chocolate chips and vanilla; beat in eggs; add flour mixture and remaining chocolate chips. Wrap in plastic and freeze until firm (about 20 minutes). Make small balls (1 inch); roll in confectioners' sugar.   Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cool on wire rack. A double dose of chocolate!
Beat eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl. Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in another shallow bowl. Gently press chicken into flour mixture to coat; shake off excess flour. Dip into egg mixture and coat completely. Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter together in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate. Cook and stir vegetable broth, sherry, and lemon juice in the same skillet; bring to a boil and cook until sauce is reduced by half. Remove from heat and add cold butter chunks; stir until butter is melted and sauce is shiny and thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir parsley into sauce and season with salt and pepper. Return chicken to the skillet over medium heat, spoon sauce over the top, and cook until chicken is heated through and no longer pink in the center, 1 to 3 minutes more. Chicken French has everything I love in a recipe. It's delicious and easy, frugal, yet fancy, and everyone loves it. Better yet, it has a vague, confusing history and completely preposterous name. This not-French recipe hails from the Rochester area of New York State, where it's a staple on virtually every Italian-American restaurant menu.
Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Pour in the melon liqueur, Southern Comfort, Banana liqueur, vodka, orange juice and sour mix. Shake vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes. Strain into a highball glass and serve. This cocktail will make your eyes squint and lay you flat! 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour the tomatoes into a 1 1/2 quart baking dish. Place the torn pieces of bread in a layer over the tomatoes, and dot with pieces of butter. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Tomatoes are baked with torn bread to make a savory tomato pudding. So simple, we love it with meatloaf and baked potatoes. I serve it at dinner parties, and I am always asked for the recipe. Add it to any oven cooked meal.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease a 9 inch pie plate. Whisk together egg, melted butter, and vanilla in a large bowl.  Puree about 1/4 cup of the sliced strawberries and whisk into the butter.  Sift together the sugar, cocoa powder, and cake flour.  Fold into the butter, and mix until well incorporated.  Use more flour if needed to end up with a mixture in between a cake batter and a cookie dough (the strawberries will add additional moisture).  Gently fold in the remaining sliced strawberries and pour the batter into prepared pie plate. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. These brownies are light and crumbly, with a punch of strawberry flavor. I made them one night with my boyfriend's daughter trying to teach her that there are no limits on what can be used when baking and cooking. I decided to use the fresh strawberries I had just purchased. I wouldn't suggest using frozen strawberries but if you do, defrost and drain well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. Prepare Cream Cheese Frosting (see footnote for link to recipe). In a medium bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.  Stir in the egg yolk, then stir in the flour until combined. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and dip in egg white. Place 1 inch apart on the cookie sheet. Make an indentation in each cookie with your finger or the end of a wooden spoon. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes; remove from oven and fill indentations with Cream Cheese Frosting. Return cookies to the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes before removing from pan. A delightful thumbprint cookie.  Delicious cream cheese filling.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread the cream cheese in a layer in a 9 inch square baking dish. Spread a layer of pizza sauce over the cream cheese, followed by layers of shredded cheese, green chilies, black olives, jalapenos, and pepperoni. Bake for 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated throughout. This is an easy hot dip that I love to serve at NASCAR parties.  Can use for any occasion and can use many different types of meats, or omit the meat entirely. Sometimes I add 3/4 pound of cooked ground turkey or lean ground beef if I want to make it more of a meal.  Add extra peppers or spices if you like your food hotter.  I usually make 2 pans, one with lots of hot stuff and one omitting the chiles, olives and peppers.
Mix shortening, flour, and salt together with a fork or a pastry blender until very crumbly.  Add as much water as needed to hold together, and mix lightly with a fork. Roll gently on a floured pastry cloth to about an inch larger than pie plate. Fold carefully in half, lift to pie plate, and unfold.  Press into pan.  For a single-crust pie, trim with a small knife to about 1/2 inch beyond rim.  Fold up, and pinch so edge of pie is raised from rim. My grandmother supported her family during the Depression by baking. This is her recipe for pie crust.  I use this often as I am a pie baker.  The trick to good pie crust is to be gentle and treat it very lightly.
Slice the top off of each tomato. Hollow out each tomato with a spoon, leaving a 1/2 to 1/4 inch shell. Place tomato pulp in a large bowl. Stir the vinegar and olive oil into the pulp, mixing to break up any large pieces. Season with salt and pepper. Evenly spoon the filling into the tomato shells. Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes before serving. Like deviled eggs, deviled tomatoes are carved and the insides mixed with other ingredients, which are put back inside. Except, the inside of the tomatoes are mixed with vinegar and olive oil rather than mayonnaise!
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Slice stems from jalapeno peppers, cut a long slit into the sides, and remove seeds from peppers. Sprinkle chicken tenderloin pieces with seasoned salt and garlic powder. Place a piece of chicken into the hollow of each pepper; top with an onion wedge. Wrap pepper completely in bacon and secure with toothpicks. Repeat with remaining peppers, chicken, onion, and bacon. Grill bacon-wrapped peppers on the preheated grill until chicken tenderloin is no longer pink, the juices run clear, the pepper is tender, and the bacon is crisp, about 15 minutes. Flip peppers occasionally during cooking. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the chicken in a pepper should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). I never really cared for the cream cheese versions of stuffed jalapeno peppers, so I came up with my own. It takes a little prep work, but they are so worth it! Serve with ranch dressing for dipping.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and reserve. In a large saucepan melt butter over medium low heat; add vodka, red pepper flakes and Worcestershire sauce. Stir well and simmer for 5 minutes. Blend in tomato sauce, tomato paste and cream; increase heat to bring to a boil. Simmer for 5 minutes or until sauce has slightly thickened; season with salt and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to very low and stir in cheese; add cooked pasta and more cheese, if desired. Serve. Penne or rigatoni served in a vodka cream sauce. So easy and when you make it, everyone is so impressed! The sauce can made a day in advance, which really brings out all the flavors.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine ingredients. Spoon into 2-qt. casserole. Bake 35 min. or until heated through. Ham and cheese--a classic pairing--make a delicious, hot and creamy casserole that's on the table in under an hour.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).  Grease an 8 inch square pan. Cut cold butter into 1/4 inch cubes.  Toss cubes with baking mix until coated.  Beat 1/2 cup milk and egg together; stir into butter mixture. Turn dough onto cloth covered board generously dusted with baking mix; roll to coat.  Fold and knead 10 times.  Roll into a 15 x 8 inch rectangle.  Spread with softened butter or margarine.  Mix sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle over dough.  Roll up tightly, beginning at 15 inch side.  Pinch edge into roll.  Cut into 12 slices with a sharp knife.  Place cut sides down in prepared pan. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes.  Remove from oven, and cool for 15 minutes. Mix confectioners sugar and  1 tablespoon milk until smooth.  Drizzle over cinnamon buns.  Serve. Nothing beats cinnamon buns on a cold morning.
Preheat an outdoor grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Place the shrimp in a bowl and toss with olive oil and salt and black pepper. Grill the shrimp on the preheated grill until opaque, 2 minutes per side. Remove from the grill and set aside. Combine the cabbage, carrot, garlic, 1 tablespoon ginger, teriyaki sauce, and lime juice in a bowl, stir well. Working with one at a time, wet rice paper with water and lay out on a clean surface. Place a quarter of the cabbage mixture in the center of the paper, top with a quarter of the shrimp. Shape the filling into a log shape and roll the rice paper around the filling, tucking the ends in as you go. Repeat with the remaining rice papers. Whisk together the peanut butter, teriyaki sauce, sesame oil, hot sauce, garlic, 1 tablespoon ginger, salt and pepper. Slice the rolls in half on an angle, and serve with the peanut sauce on the side. These shrimp summer rolls are great, and taste even better if you want to oven-bake or fry them as well. It only takes about 20 minutes to make, so it is much quicker than take out. These come highly recommended, you may want to make a double batch.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Peel, core and cube the apples. Lightly grease a 13x9 inch baking pan. Cover the bottom with half of the bread cubes and then sprinkle on half of the apples. Repeat with the remaining bread and apples. In a large mixing bowl combine the eggs, cream, sugar, milk and cinnamon; beat well. Pour this mixture evenly over the bread cubes and apples. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Serve hot. Awesome bread pudding with fresh apples and cream! Best served hot with ice cream.
Blend roasted red peppers, mayonnaise, garlic, and cayenne pepper in a food processor until smooth. Season with salt and black pepper. A delightful roasted red pepper spread that can be used as a veggie dip, a base for pizza, a sauce for pasta, a topping for burgers or sandwiches, and much, much more.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Sprinkle each  flattened breast with garlic salt and pepper to taste on both sides. Lay a slice of ham onto each breast, then a slice of Swiss cheese. Roll each breast up like a cinnamon  roll. Secure with a toothpick if necessary. Wrap a piece of bacon loosely around each roll. Place the rolled breasts in a 2 quart glass baking dish and pour in chicken broth. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the juices run clear.  Broil for a few minutes before serving to crisp up the bacon. Wonderful and easy dish made with chicken breast, honey ham, bacon, and Swiss cheese!  Yummy!
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly oil a baking dish. Combine crab, poblano pepper, panko bread crumbs, green onion, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Stir mayonnaise, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Place sole fillets, flat-side up, on a work surface. Season fillets with salt. Divide crab mixture between fillets and roll filets up around filling. Place rolled sole in the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/2 the mayonnaise mixture over the sides and tops of each sole roll to coat. Place remaining 1/2 the mayonnaise mixture in a piping bag. Pipe mayonnaise mixture in a zigzag pattern over the top of each roll and sprinkle paprika over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until browned on top and fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. There is nothing exciting about sole. It's cheap, easy to find, has a mild, unremarkable flavor, and that's about it. Which means it's the perfect candidate for jazzing up by stuffing with crab. Serve with asparagus and lemon.
Stir the cornstarch, stock, soy sauce and sesame oil in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and stir-fry until they're cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the skillet. Heat the remaining vegetable oil in the skillet. Add the vegetables, ginger and garlic powder and stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir the cornstarch mixture in the skillet. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Return the shrimp to the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve over the rice. Tender shrimp and crisp vegetables are stir-fried with a garlic and ginger flavored sauce made from Swanson® Chicken Stock, soy sauce and sesame oil, for a savory seafood and vegetable stir-fry.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 10 inch tube pan. Sprinkle sliced apples with 5 tablespoons white sugar and the ground cinnamon. Toss to coat and set aside. Mix the flour, eggs, 2 1/2 cups sugar, baking powder, salt, vegetable oil, orange juice and vanilla until well blended. Batter will be fairly stiff. Pour 1/2  of the batter into the prepared pan. Place the apple mixture over the batter then pour the remaining batter over the top. Bake at  350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 to 80 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Yellow cake filled with apples and cinnamon.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place swai fish in a glass casserole dish and season with salt and black pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion until softened, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour tomatoes over onion mixture; cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Spoon tomato mixture over fish. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. This is one of my favorite recipes for any kind of white fish.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground turkey in hot oil until turkey is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain excess fat. Stir chicken broth and taco seasoning mix into turkey; cook and stir until liquid reduces and thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir orzo into turkey mixture, bring to a simmer, and cook until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add salsa to turkey-orzo mixture, stir, and transfer mixture to a 2-quart casserole dish. Stir muffin mix, creamed corn, and milk together in a bowl. Spread corn mixture over turkey mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the casserole comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Spread Mexican cheese blend over the top of the casserole and bake until cheese melts, about 5 minutes. A layer of succulent turkey with pasta to soak up the Mexican flavors under a moist, sweet corn-bread cheese topping.  Serve with a salad for a complete meal.
Pour 1 can vegetable broth and water into a large pot. Place potatoes and cabbage into pot, and bring to a boil. Cook 10 minutes, or until potatoes are tender but firm. Place the beef in a skillet over medium heat, and cook until evenly brown. Drain grease and mix beef into the pot. Stir the onion, celery, green bell pepper, and garlic into the skillet. Cook until tender, then mix into the pot. Pour remaining broth and tomato-vegetable juice cocktail into the pot. Mix in tomatoes, frozen mixed vegetables, okra, lima beans, beef bouillon, Worcestershire sauce, celery seed, and bacon grease. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer 2 hours. This is truly delicious! This is a variation of my mother-in-laws soup with a little more vegetable and broth to make it more of a meal. I hope you enjoy it!
Place potato halves into a large pot of salted water, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until very tender, about 15 minutes. A knife should pierce the middle of a potato half easily. Transfer potatoes to a colander and drain thoroughly, about 5 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Whisk mascarpone cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. Stir egg yolk and milk into mascarpone cheese, whisking until smooth; season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Transfer potatoes to a separate large mixing bowl, add butter chunks to potatoes, and season with salt and black pepper. Mash butter into potatoes with a potato masher until fluffy; a few lumps are okay. Whisk mascarpone mixture into mashed potatoes. Spread mashed potatoes into a 9x13-inch baking dish. Smooth the top and use the tip of a spatula to lightly press the potatoes and lift up to create little peaks and valleys in the top. Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are heated through and top is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Not only is this a delicious alternative to regular mashed potato recipes, but it's a very user-friendly way to serve your potato side dish. They're really decadent: not too rich, but just rich enough, and perfect for any special occasion.
Saute onions in butter or margarine until transparent.  Place in 2-quart baking dish. In a small bowl, beat eggs well.  Stir in cream, and season with  salt and pepper.  Pour mixture over onions, and sprinkle cheese. Bake, uncovered, at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes. Simple to prepare, this creamy onion dish is sure to become a holiday favorite.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large casserole dish. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, feta cheese, black pepper, onion salt, garlic powder, basil, oregano, parsley, and thyme into ground beef. Simmer until flavors blend, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour ground beef mixture over cavatappi. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes before serving. I came up with this on the fly when I did not want to take the time for full-blown lasagna. My kids are all picky eaters and all asked for seconds! Measurements for spices and herbs are approximate. I do not measure when I cook.
Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat, and saute the onion until tender. Stir in the tomatoes and spinach, and continue cooking until the spinach is wilted. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the Roquefort cheese, and allow to melt slightly before serving. This is a quick and easy side dish I made up to complement any fish or chicken dish with spinach, diced tomatoes, and that rich Roquefort cheese (any blue cheese will work).
Fill a pint glass with ice; add lemonade, vodka, and top with club soda. Garnish with lemon wedge. Sweet tea vodka mixes up with lemonade in this refreshing adult variation on the Arnold Palmer. Top it off with a little soda water and garnish with a lemon wedge. It's always a favorite cocktail at Nikki's Bar in Venice Beach, California.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place farfalle pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the garlic until lightly browned. Mix in red pepper and lemon juice. Stir in the pine nuts, olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. Toss in the cooked pasta and feta cheese. Season with salt and pepper. This wonderful and easy skillet pasta dish includes sun-dried tomatoes, olives, pine nuts, feta cheese, and crushed red pepper flakes. This is an authentic alternative that gets rave reviews in our family.
Mix tomato sauce, tomato paste, ground black pepper, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, thyme, cilantro, parsley, and onion salt together in a bowl until well combined. Delicious, healthy, and easy-to-make pizza sauce.
Break up sausage in a skillet and brown.  Remove from skillet and set aside. With remaining drippings, add 1/2 to 1 cup of the flour and stir.  Make sure that all of the drippings are absorbed. Stir in milk a little at a time until creamy.  Top with the cooked sausage, salt and pepper to taste. Hearty pork sausage and gravy to pour over homemade biscuits or toast.  Water may be substituted for the milk.
Make a roux by whisking the flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings together in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat to form a smooth mixture. Cook the roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking. Place the celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until the vegetables are very finely chopped. Stir the vegetables into the roux, and mix in the sausage. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside. Bring the water and beef bouillon cubes to a boil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot. Stir until the bouillon cubes dissolve, and whisk the roux mixture into the boiling water. Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in the sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Simmer the soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark. Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of bacon drippings in a skillet, and cook the okra with vinegar over medium heat for 15 minutes; remove okra with slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering gumbo. Mix in crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. Just before serving, stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder. I am going to give you my gumbo recipe. I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother who were born and raised in New Orleans and really knew how to cook. Most of the time, you could not get them to write down their recipes because they used a 'pinch' of this and 'just enough of that' and 'two fingers of water,' and so on. This recipe is a combination of both of their recipes which I have added to over the years. Serve over hot cooked rice. The gumbo can be frozen or refrigerated and many people like it better the next day. Bon appetit!
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook quinoa pasta in boiling water for 2 minutes; add broccoli and carrots to the water. Continue cooking pasta and vegetables until pasta is cooked through but firm to the bite, 4 to 7 minutes; drain. Rinse with cold water until cool; drain. Transfer pasta mixture to a large mixing bowl. Toss artichoke hearts with marinade, Italian salad dressing, grape tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese, olives, and parsley with the pasta mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight. I wanted to adapt a pasta salad recipe for a party with gluten-sensitive friends attending. I love artichoke hearts and olives! You can serve the feta cheese on the side, so even vegans can share!
Put the chocolate bar into a microwave-safe bowl and add the milk. Microwave until the chocolate is soft and melted, about 30 seconds. Stir Greek yogurt into the chocolate mixture until smooth. A very quick and easy way to make something like mousse that is quite healthy and great for the family. The ingredient amounts can be altered according to the cook's desire to have a more or less chocolatey concoction. Different kinds of chocolate can be used also, like dark chocolate.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10-inch square baking dish and line it with parchment paper. Place the pumpkin in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and cook in microwave on full power, stirring halfway through cooking time, until tender, about 5 minutes. Place the potato in a microwave-safe bowl; cover and cook in microwave on full power until tender enough to pierce with a fork, about 4 minutes. Combine the pumpkin and potato in a large bowl. Add the spinach, feta cheese, Cheddar cheese, and eggs; stir. Transfer mixture to prepared dish; top with sliced onion. Bake in preheated oven until firm, about 25 minutes. Allow to rest 5 minutes before serving. In Australia, and some other overseas countries, pumpkin means squash. I like to use butternut squash because it's sweet. You can also substitute frozen egg whites for all those eggs and cut back on fat and calories. This would make a great brunch, but we like it for supper. It's even good cold.
Lightly smack each orange on the counter. Cut each one in half. Squeeze into a glass. You may also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less pulp, use a hand juicer with a strainer. In response to a request about how to make fresh squeezed orange juice. It takes a little work, but it tastes much better than orange juice from concentrate.
Place the avocados in a bowl, and stir in the bacon, tomatoes, onion, and garlic until well blended. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add hot pepper sauce, if desired. Serve immediately. Crispy, crumbled bacon adds a tasty variation to traditional guacamole. Serve with tortilla or pita chips.
Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Gently mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt with a fork in a bowl. Beat the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add the eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Mix in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in the chocolate chips; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Divide the dough into 24 3-tablespoon-sized balls. Flatten the balls to about 1/4-inch thick onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden, 15 to 17 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet until the centers begin to set, about 20 minutes. After years of tweaking my chocolate chip recipe, it is now ready for public consumption. It has been laboratory-tested on many of my friends all of whom seem to think its pretty great, as do I. They certainly aren't healthy, but its well worth the requisite post-cookie eating cardio workout. I hope it works for you as well as it has for me! Enjoy!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small baking dish, mix the pineapple with juice, sugar, cinnamon, eggs, and tapioca. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until set. This is a great side dish. It is especially good with pork or ham, but we have had it with many different meals!
Mix the teriyaki sauce, garlic, ginger, and red pepper flakes in a bowl; stir in the chicken pieces until thoroughly coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the chicken 3 to 4 hours to overnight. Remove a piece of chicken from the marinade and place into the center of an aluminum square. Fold the square diagonally over the chicken piece in a triangle shape; fold up the open edges of the triangle several times and press tightly together to seal the chicken into the foil. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces. Discard the used marinade. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gently add the sealed foil packets to the hot oil and fry until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain the packets on paper towels and allow to cool slightly. To serve, tear open the packets along the sealed edges. I eat this quite a bit at our local Chinese restaurants, so I recreated it at home and made it even tastier. These are time-consuming, and I recommend using oil in the deep fryer that is ready to change as the marinade will ruin it for cooking anything else. I've also done this technique successfully with squid. I've also added in very thinly sliced onion and green peppers to the marinade and it was really good.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Smear 1/4 teaspoon mustard inside each butterflied hot dog. Put 2 Cheddar cheese matchsticks inside each hot dog. Secure one end of a bacon strip to one end a hot dog using a toothpick. Wrap the bacon strip tightly around the entire hot dog, securing the far end with another toothpick; repeat for remaining hot dogs. Cook on preheated grill until hot dogs are heated and bacon is cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Place each cooked hot dog onto a bun and top with 2 pickle slices. This is a fun and easy way to amp up your hot dogs for the grill with some cheese, bacon, and a few other classic hot dog topping ingredients! These come together quickly and are ready in no time. They go great with all your favorite BBQ side dishes: corn on the cob, pasta salad, baked beans, watermelon, etc.
Butter a 9x13 inch pan and set aside. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Arrange almonds on a cookie sheet and place in oven to toast. Stir frequently. Do not burn. Remove from oven and set aside. In a heavy saucepan, combine sugar, butter, milk, pumpkin, and spice; bring to a boil, stirring constantly.  Continue boiling over medium heat until mixture reaches 234 degrees F (118 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in butterscotch chips.

Combine all ingredients in a jar, and let sit for at least an hour to steep the flavors in the oil.  Sprinkle generously on the lettuce in your sub or directly on the insides of the bun. This sounds absurdly simple but is wonderful, especially when really great Italian meats and cheeses are used; but it really jazzes up routine lunch meats on a sub, too.  I highly recommend the addition of a good dollop of Holland House hot cherry pepper relish.  It's heavenly - had it at a sub shop on Boylston Street in Boston in the 70's and dreamed about it for years.  Finally discovered it at an Italian grocery in Seattle and was thrilled to discover that same fabulous flavor.  Try it, you'll love it!

Mix in shortening using a fork, until the entire mixture is in pea-sized pellets. Stir in yogurt, and just enough of the 1/2 cup of cold water to hold it together in a dough. Roll out dough to a square 1/8 inch in thickness. Use a knife to cut into four 8x8 inch squares. Don't worry if they aren't perfect. Drain the raisins, and mix with the cinnamon and chopped bananas. Spoon some of the banana mixture onto half of each square, leaving at least 1/2 inch of dough exposed at the edge to seal the edges. Fold the dough over the fruit, and pinch the edges together. Make sure that they are secure.  I like to roll the excess dough up around the edges and then pinch it until it's thin again.  You'll want to have about a 1/2 inch closure in the end.  You can trim the edges a bit to make them more aesthetically pleasing. Place empanadas on a baking sheet. Whisk together 1 tablespoon of cold water and egg white; brush over the tops. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. I love banana empanadas and I wanted to see if I could make them.  This is what I came up with and I wanted to share.  They're pocket pies.  You can make them with other fresh fruits (peaches, apples, apricots, pears, etc.) or with canned fruit filling.  The good thing about bananas is that you don't have to add any sugar and the empanadas still taste great.  If you use other fresh fruits you may want to consider adding about 1 tablespoon of sugar to the inside of each pocket. You may also sprinkle them with cinnamon-sugar as soon as they come out of the oven.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Press the pie crust into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, then layer the turkey meat over the crust; spoon the cream of chicken soup over the turkey. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat, and stir in the mixed vegetables; cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Whisk the dry gravy mix with the remaining 1 cup of water, then stir the gravy mixture into the mixed vegetables. Bring to a boil, then simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Pour the vegetables and gravy over the cream of chicken soup layer in the pan. Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the pie. Bake in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling, about 45 minutes. All the comfort of a pot pie topped with mashed potatoes. It's a great way to use up extra turkey or chicken.
Rinse and strain soaked beans. Place in a large saucepan, and cover with water.  Boil for 2 to 3 minutes.  Drain, discarding the water. Cover the beans with 3 cups water, and bring to a boil.   Add onions, carrots, celery, tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, thyme, olive oil, and salt and pepper.  Cover.  Cook for about 50 to 60 minutes, until the beans are soft.  Mix the parsley. If using a pressure cooker, cook all ingredients except parsley for 3 to 4 minutes under 15 pounds pressure.  Stir in parsley. Fasolatha is the national Greek dish.  It has nourished generations. Olive oil is one of the vital ingredients of this delicious dish so do not economize with it.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray 12-cup muffin tin with non-stick baking spray. Combine sugar, egg and oil in a large bowl and stir together with a wire whisk. Add buttermilk and blueberry juice cocktail and stir with whisk until blended. Combine bran cereal, flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add to juice mixture and stir just until dry ingredients are moistened. Fold in blueberries. Let mixture sit 20 minutes to allow cereal to soften. Scoop evenly into muffin cups. Bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Try delicious Blueberry Bran Muffins from Ocean Spray for a treat the whole family can enjoy all summer long.
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line an 11-17-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly spray with cooking spray. Mix milk and ranch dressing in a shallow bowl. Place flour in a separate shallow bowl; set aside. Whisk together bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, seasoned salt, black pepper, celery salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, parsley, and basil in a bowl. Spray bread crumb mixture with cooking spray until damp, then whisk bread crumbs. Repeat spraying and whisking 3 more times to lightly moisten crumb mixture with cooking spray. Transfer crumb mixture to a large resealable plastic bag. Gently press tilapia fillets into the flour to coat, and shake off the excess flour. Dip the fillets into the ranch dressing mixture. Place all the fillets into the resealable plastic bag; seal bag and shake to coat fish with bread crumb mixture. Arrange tilapia on prepared baking sheet. Lightly spray the breaded fish with cooking spray. Bake in the preheated oven until the fish is easily flaked with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. A quick and yummy way to prepare crispy tilapia the whole family will love, without frying. I get asked to make this several times a week by everyone in my family, especially the kids!
Puree the parsley, rosemary, garlic, Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and bread crumbs in a blender until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. Brush the lamb steaks on one side with the beaten egg. Spread the rosemary pesto onto the egg-coated side of the lamb, coating liberally. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place the lamb steaks into the pan, pesto-side down. Cook 3 to 4 minutes until the pesto mixture has lightly browned. Turn the steaks over, and continue cooking until done to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 4 minutes for medium. Boneless lamb steaks are coated with a rosemary-Parmesan cheese crust, and pan-fried to perfection!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a loaf pan with cooking spray. Place tofu, eggs, onion soup mix, and soy sauce into a food processor or blender; process until combined. Add walnuts and puree until smooth. Transfer tofu mixture to a large bowl. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and celery in the hot oil until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Season with oregano, basil, and sage. Stir vegetables and bread crumbs into tofu mixture; press mixture into prepared loaf pan. Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is golden brown, about 75 minutes. Allow loaf to cool slightly before slicing. This meatloaf has a lot of flavor and is very satisfying if you are craving protein. My husband and I, both vegetarians, made this for my brother, a hunter and meat-enthusiast, and he really liked it. The best thing about this meatloaf is the next day when I can have a cold meatloaf sandwich with mayonnaise.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add gnocchi, and cook until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, crumble the sausage into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Drain grease, and stir in the spaghetti sauce. Remove from heat, and carefully mix in the cooked gnocchi and half of the mozzarella cheese. Transfer to a casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbly. A quick and easy blend of gnocchi, sausage, cheese, and your favorite spaghetti sauce baked together for a hearty casserole.
Combine 1 bottle hot pepper sauce, 1/2 cup butter, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Place chicken wings into slow cooker and pour sauce mixture over wings. Cook on High for 2 hours. Reduce heat to Low; cook 2 hours more. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease several baking sheets. Spread wings onto prepared baking sheets and bake in preheated oven until wings are crisp and browned, about 30 minutes. Melt 1/2 cup butter with 1 bottle hot sauce in a small saucepan and simmer until thickened, about 20 minutes. Brush sauce onto wings just before serving. I made these wings for Super Bowl®; they were gone in five minutes and super-easy to make! Serve with ranch or blue cheese dressing.
Cook angel hair pasta in a large pot of boiling water until al dente. Saute bell pepper, green onion, and bean sprouts until tender-crispy. Set aside. Saute chicken until done. Set aside. Mix peanut butter, soy sauce, and ginger in a large saucepan over medium low heat.  Add chicken broth.  Add pasta, sauteed vegetables, and chicken.  Toss to coat all ingredients.  Serve immediately. This pasta dish has a slightly Asian flavor, and is spicy.
Stir the cornstarch, stock, soy sauce and sesame oil in a small bowl until the mixture is smooth. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and stir-fry until they're cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the skillet. Heat the remaining vegetable oil in the skillet. Add the vegetables, ginger and garlic powder and stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Stir the cornstarch mixture in the skillet. Cook and stir until the mixture boils and thickens. Return the shrimp to the skillet and cook until the mixture is hot and bubbling. Serve over the rice. Tender shrimp and crisp vegetables are stir-fried with a garlic and ginger flavored sauce made from Swanson® Chicken Stock, soy sauce and sesame oil, for a savory seafood and vegetable stir-fry.
Combine crackers with cereal in a large mixing bowl; set aside. Cook corn syrup and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until mixture comes to a boil just around edges.  Remove from heat; stir in butter, baking soda and vanilla. (OR in a 1-quart microwave-safe bowl, microwave on HIGH (100%) for about 2 minutes or until syrup boils.) Pour syrup over cereal mixture and stir to coat completely.  Transfer to a greased 13 x 9-inch pan; press firmly to level.  Place chocolate bars in a single layer over cereal mixture; sprinkle with marshmallows. Bake in a preheated 400 degrees F oven for 5 to 8 minutes, or until marshmallows are puffed and lightly browned.  Remove from oven and top with mini chocolate chips. Refrigerate for 1 hour until firm; cut into squares.  Store in tightly closed container for up to 2 days. All the flavors of beloved S'Mores in a cereal bar!
Mix olive oil, Parmesan, garlic, mayonnaise, vinegar, bread crumbs, sesame oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, chili powder, black pepper, basil, hot pepper sauce, salt, oregano, paprika, and cayenne pepper in a shaker or bottle with a lid; shake vigorously. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours to let the flavors combine. This is my own variant of the classic Caesar salad dressing, but without using raw egg so that the dressing keeps longer and doesn't spoil so easily. It's also a bit more piquant than the classic version and uses more cheese (because more cheese is always good). To make it more decorative in the bottle, try adding large sprigs of fresh basil to the dressing after shaking it. Makes a nice gift, and fresh basil tastes better, too.
Whisk the beer, wine vinegar, corn syrup, mustard, garlic, sage, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add the onion and pork chops, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 12 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the pork chops and onions from the marinade and set aside on a platter. Drain the marinade through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding the strained liquid. Spread the garlic mixture caught in the strainer over the pork chops. Wrap the onions in aluminum foil. Cook the packet of onions and the pork chops on the preheated grill until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Tender full-flavored pork chops that are always a crowd pleaser. Great on the grill! Pat dry the meat before you put it on the grill for good grill marks. Also, use a meat thermometer to insure proper cooking.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season flour, eggs, and bread crumbs with salt and pepper. Mix cayenne pepper into the flour only. Dip each breast into flour, then into the beaten eggs, and then into the bread crumbs, coating evenly. Place onto a greased cookie sheet. Bake for 15 minutes on each side or until brown and crispy. While chicken bakes, heat oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and Brussels sprouts and stir until garlic releases its fragrance and sprouts are heated through, about 2 minutes. Stir in the flour. Then add the water, lemon juice, drained beans, and sugar. Stir over medium heat until sauce thickens, about 8 minutes. Add additional water if sauce is too thick. Remove from the heat and stir in remaining butter, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, salt and pepper. Place each piece of chicken onto a serving plate. Spoon the sauce over it and garnish with chopped parsley and remaining Parmesan cheese. At a highly-rated Italian restaurant chain I ordered the Veal Limone with Tuscan Beans and Escarole. It was amazing, but a bit pricey. So I made my own recipe with easier-to-find and affordable ingredients: chicken breasts, navy beans, and Brussels sprouts.
Blend kosher salt, cumin, oregano, minced garlic, chili powder, 1 teaspoon ground black pepper, celery seed, and ground thyme together in a food processor. Lay baby back rib slabs and sparerib rack on sheets of aluminum foil. Rub spice mixture all over ribs and fold aluminum foil up around each. Divide apple juice between each foil packet and fold foil edges together to form a seal. Marinate ribs 8 hours to overnight. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place jalapeno peppers, cut-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet. Cook jalapeno peppers under the preheated broiler until the skin has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes. Place the blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow the peppers to steam as they cool, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard skins. Blend jalapeno peppers, beer, onion, strawberry preserves, barbeque sauce, olive oil, garlic cloves, sea salt, and pinch ground black pepper together in a blender until sauce is smooth. Transfer sauce to a container, cover with a lid, and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place foil-wrapped ribs in a single layer on baking sheets. Cook ribs in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Increase oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) and continue cooking ribs until almost tender, 2 to 3 hours more. Preheat smoker to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Unwrap ribs, discard apple juice, and place ribs directly on the smoker. Cook on the preheated smoker until meat surface is slightly dry, 5 to 10 minutes. Continue cooking, brushing sauce on ribs every 15 minutes and turning every 30 minutes, until tender, about 1 hour. This was a refreshing change.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix graham cracker crumbs, confectioners' sugar, butter, and cocoa powder together in a bowl; divide between 12 muffin cups and press into the bottoms to form an even crust in each. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Move to a cooling rack to cool completely. Scoop enough ice cream atop the cooled crusts to fill the muffin cups 3/4-full. Top each with whipped topping to fill completely. Put muffin cups in the freezer until the ice cream and whipped topping are firm, about 4 hours. When ready to serve, dip each muffin cup into a bowl of warm water for about 5 seconds and turn onto a plate. These are a great make-ahead desserts for a birthday party!
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, oil, sugar and soy sauce.  Set aside. Melt the margarine over medium heat in a small skillet.   Crush the ramen noodles while still in their packaging, and add to the margarine along with the almonds and sesame seeds.  Saute until everything is golden brown.  Remove from heat and drain on a paper towel. Chop the bok choy and green onions and add to a large bowl.  Just before serving, sprinkle with the noodle mixture and dressing, and toss to coat. Crunchy bok choy is drizzled with sweetened soy vinaigrette and speckled with toasted almonds, sesame seeds and ramen noodles.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain and cool bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble. Reserve bacon drippings in skillet. Heat a stovetop grill over medium heat and cook shrimp until pink and no longer translucent in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Place cooked shrimp, green onion, garlic, and crumbled bacon in the bacon drippings left in the skillet. Turn heat to low and keep shrimp mixture warm. Bring water to a boil in a large saucepan, melt butter in the water, stir in grits, and cook covered for 5 minutes. Turn heat to low. Stir shrimp mixture with bacon drippings into the grits; stir in Cheddar cheese until thoroughly melted and combined. Serve topped with barbeque sauce. For our honeymoon, Aaron and I took a road trip down the east coast. We stopped in Charleston, SC and had shrimp  grits for the first time. OH MAN! It was SOOOO good. Aaron ordered it as appetizer and we liked it so much he got it as an entree too! Since you can't find shrimp and grits on a menu anywhere in Richmond, VA, Aaron came up with his own recipe and topped it off with BBQ sauce. YUM, YUM, YUM!!!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place onion and celery into a pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Simmer until tender, about 3 minutes. Drain. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir beef until it is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir in onion mixture, ketchup, tomato soup, 1/2 can tomato paste, garlic salt, salt, and pepper; set aside to cool. Mix remaining 1 1/2 cans tomato paste, oregano, and sugar in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Butter each English muffin half, then spread with tomato paste mixture. Divide ground beef mixture over each muffin half and top with strips of American cheese. Place open-faced sandwiches on large baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese melts, about 15 minutes. These can be made in mass quantities and frozen to make a quick after school snack!
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Season both sides of each catfish fillet with Greek seasoning. Sprinkle feta cheese and mint over one side of each fillet; drizzle olive oil over the cheese and mint. Beginning with narrower end, roll fish tightly around the filling and secure with a toothpick. Cook on preheated grill until the fish flakes easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. I enjoy grilling out all year, no matter what the weather. I came up with this recipe by experimenting because my wife would eat fish everyday for every meal if I would cook it. Our whole family likes the unique taste of this dish.
Whisk together yogurt, garlic, 3 tablespoons paprika, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 tablespoon hot chile paste, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Mix in chicken pieces and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken pieces dry with more paper towels. Season with salt. Combine 1/4 cup olive oil, sherry vinegar, ketchup, 1/8 teaspoon hot chile paste, pinch paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl. Set aside. Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 4 minutes with grill lid closed. Turn chicken and grill with lid closed until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Spoon sherry vinegar mixture over cooked chicken and serve. While this is a pretty straightforward grilled chicken recipe, the vinaigrette at the end was a last minute touch that worked out nicely. I really like oil and vinegar-based sauces on grilled meats. They work beautifully with the smoky, caramelized exterior.
In a blender, combine cantaloupe, honeydew, lime juice and sugar. Blend until smooth. Pour into glasses and serve. This one is great when melons are in season.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the garlic in the olive oil until just golden, approximately 2 minutes. Be careful not to burn the garlic. Add the tomatoes and sprinkle with salt and cayenne pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Season the shrimp with salt and add to the tomatoes. Cook 3 to 5 minutes, or until no longer pink. Stir in 1 tablespoon of butter for added richness, if desired. This recipe is very simple and a real all-around favorite. It even tastes great the next day, that is, if you have leftovers! Serve over pasta or rice with a bottle of red wine and some crusty bread for a fantastic and impressive dinner.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, flour and butter; mix on low speed with an electric mixer until crumbly. Remove 1 cup of crumb mixture and set aside to be used for topping. To the remainder, add egg, baking soda, milk, vanilla and salt. Batter will be thin; pour into prepared pan. Sprinkle top with chopped walnuts, toffee bits and reserved crumb mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool. A quick crumb cake with toffee bits, chopped nuts and streusel topping...enjoy!
To Make Dough: Combine flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 cup water. Mix together. Dough should be as soft as an ear lobe. Divide the dough into two pieces, cover with a wet cloth and set aside. Fill a large pot with water. Add 1 teaspoon salt and a whole peeled onion. Bring water to a boil and boil whole chicken in water until it is tender. Remove chicken from pot, remove bones and cut chicken meat into small pieces. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Melt 2 tablespoons butter/margarine in pot over medium heat. Add rice, turn heat to high and cook rice, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and 6 cups water. Cover pot. Bring water to a boil, then remove cover, reduce heat to low and simmer about 10 minutes, until the rice absorbs all of the water. Roll 2 reserved dough pieces out into 2 separate rounds/circles to fit a 10 inch pie dish. Lay one round of dough in the lightly greased pie dish. Spoon in the rice mixture and season with fresh ground black pepper. Spread the chicken pieces on top of the rice and cover with the second dough round. Pinch the sides closed, trimming off any excess dough. Brush top with egg and bake in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes. Kobete is ready when the top is a nice yellowish brown. Kobete Chicken is a delicious whole meal from Turkish cuisine. You are sure to be famous among your friends and family members after they taste your Kobete! AFIYET OLSUN, which means 'enjoy your meal' in Turkish!
Fill a hurricane glass with ice. Pour in the rum, coconut rum, vodka, gin, triple sec, orange juice, pineapple juice, and grenadine. Stir well with a bar spoon, then pour the 151 rum over the back of the spoon to float the liquor on top of the drink. Garnish the glass with orange, lime, and a cherry. Sip with a straw from the bottom for a 'sneak up on you' punch or sip from the top for a 'knock you down' twister. This beverage is known for its 'sneak up and blow you away' power.  There are many different versions, but I believe you will find mine a very good blend of rums, other alcoholic beverages and fruit juices. If you can walk after two of these...well...you just think you can.  Everything is bigger and better in Texas -- just try this and see.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk garlic, olive oil, rosemary, mustard, lemon juice, ground black pepper, and salt together in a bowl. Place chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag. Pour garlic mixture over chicken, reserving 1/8 cup. Seal bag and massage marinade into chicken. Let stand for 30 minutes at room temperature. Place chicken on preheated grill and cook for 4 minutes. Turn the chicken, baste with reserved marinade, and continue to grill until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Cover with foil and let rest for at least 2 minutes before serving. This easy, quick, and light dish has exceptional flavor.  The rosemary plays perfectly with strong garlic flavor and a hint of lemon for bright fresh flavor. This is a must try for summer.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil the grate. Place basil, oil, garlic, Romano cheese, oregano, and pepper into a blender. Blend on high until smooth, adding additional oil if necessary, about 30 seconds. Grill chicken until juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. Do not turn off grill. Spoon 1 tablespoon of Caesar dressing onto 2 slices of bread. Top each with lettuce, and an additional slice of bread. Spread the second slice of bread thickly with the pesto. Top each sandwich with a cooked chicken breast, a slice of smoked mozzarella, and the remaining bread. Grill sandwiches until the cheese is melted, and the bread is toasted, about 3 minutes per side. This sandwich is tasty for lunch or dinner.  I experimented and came up with it one night when I wanted to make something quick, easy, and tasty for my girlfriend who loves pesto sauce.  Enjoy!
In a heavy medium saucepan, simmer the beef in 1/4 inch of water. Stew until very tender, about 2 to 3 hours, replacing water as necessary. Drain, reserving the liquid. Pass the cooked stew meat through a meat grinder twice, until it is the consistency of a thick, stringy paste. In a small saucepan, melt the butter. Filter the melted butter through clean muslin (cheese cloth), to remove the milk solids. In a medium bowl, mix the cooked meat with 3/4 of the strained, melted butter. Season with salt, pepper, paprika and nutmeg to taste. Stir in desired amount of reserved cooking liquid to moisten. Transfer the mixture to sterile containers and top with remaining butter. Seal and chill in the refrigerator until serving. Old fashioned potted beef is great on toast. This recipe was invented to be kept for long periods of time unrefrigerated, but in practice it must be kept in the refrigerator and used within a week. Other kinds of meat may be used instead of beef.
Place the pear slices in a skillet, and pour in the apple juice. Cook over medium heat until the pears are soft, about 5 minutes. Drain pears and reserve; discard juice. Meanwhile, place the bacon in a skillet and cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels. Crumble and set aside. Preheat the oven broiler. Place the focaccia bread slices on a baking sheet. Divide the pear slices evenly among the bread, and top evenly with the bacon, and then with the blue cheese. Broil the sandwiches in the preheated broiler until the cheese melts, about 2 minutes. The original idea for this came from a friend. I varied the type of cheese and bread, and added a finishing step to create these tasty little sandwiches. I used low-sodium bacon, however, I think any bacon would work well. Served with a side salad of mixed greens and fresh berries, this makes a great brunch or light supper sandwich.
Melt the butter and chocolate chips in a heavy saucepan over medium heat; mix until smooth and creamy; remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. Fold in the marshmallows and walnuts. Scatter about half of the coconut onto a large baking sheet. Form the chocolate mixture into two oblong logs and lay them onto the coconut. Use the remaining coconut to coat the logs. Refrigerate until the logs are firm, about 1 hour. Cut logs into 3/4-inch slices. I see two other recipes for these, but this is our version we use every year. They are an absolute hit at cookie exchanges as they are different, not to mention very easy and tasty!
Combine milk and sugar together in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Whisk water and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; stir into boiling milk. Cook milk mixture over medium heat until thickened to the consistency of cake batter, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir cream, rose water, and cardamom into milk mixture. Refrigerate milk mixture until completely cooled, 2 to 4 hours. This was a favorite of mine during Ramadan! Serve pudding on small plates with chopped nuts on the top.
Heat a large skillet to about 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) or over medium heat. Place eggplant in a large bowl and add salt; stir. Add red onion, yellow onion, and green bell pepper and stir. Mix garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and cayenne into vegetable mixture. Crack egg over vegetable mixture and stir. Add bread crumbs and stir well. Pour olive oil into hot skillet. Cover skillet and cook vegetable mixture in the hot oil, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft, about 20 minutes. This happened by accident during my first year as a gardener. I quickly tired of the whole 'salt/wait/rinse' routine of prepping eggplant, and tried it this way. The first time we made this, the hubs asked me what kind of sausage I had used in it as it tastes 'meaty'. We both stared at the empty bowl in amazement as I am not a good cook and this is GOOD! I serve this with sausage or any type of grilled meat. If doubled, it is a meal in itself.
Blend the basil, spinach, parsley, garlic, pecans, lemon zest, lemon juice, Parmesan cheese, Pecorino Romano cheese, cayenne pepper, sea salt, and black pepper in a food processor until all ingredients are integrated. With the food processor running, slowly drizzle the olive oil into the mixture until the mixture forms a paste. A delicious pesto with traditional ingredients. This has been booted up with some southern fried kick. You can spray ice cube trays with cooking spray and spoon in pesto, freeze until hard, and store in freezer in a resealable plastic bag.
In the top of a double boiler, combine gelatin, egg whites, sugar, water and cream of tartar.  Using an electric mixer, beat icing over boiling water until soft peaks form.  Remove from heat.  Continue to beat until icing forms stiff peaks.  Use to frost a completely cooled cake. Easy and pretty!
Set aside a few pretty strawberry slices for garnish; sprinkle remaining strawberries with sugar in a bowl and let stand for 10 minutes for juice to form. Mix mascarpone cheese and whipped topping together in a separate bowl. Place torn pieces of angel food cake into a trifle dish; spread strawberries and their juice on cake pieces and top with mascarpone mixture. Decorate with retained strawberry slices. Refrigerate until serving time. Fast and easy, but very rich and delicious.  Pretty in a clear glass trifle dish or individual parfait glasses.
Melt the butter in a large stock pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the butternut squash, sweet potatoes, and enough vegetable broth to cover. Stir in the thyme, ginger, turmeric, coriander, black pepper, and chile pepper. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until vegetables are very tender, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove and discard the chile pepper. Pour about 1/3 of the soup and 1/3 of the tofu into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Repeat with the remaining soup and tofu. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup and tofu right in the cooking pot. A delightfully rich-tasting soup. My husband likes this soup so much he refers to all butternut squashes as soup now. I recommend this with the silken tofu instead of milk - it adds protein to a fiber-rich soup, and no one will know it's there if you don't tell them! Serve warm with a sprinkling of grated Parmesan or Romano and some crusty toasted bread on the side.
Arrange two banana halves in each of 4 ice cream dishes. Top each with three scoops ice cream. Sprinkle with chopped Butterfinger, then drizzle with Nesquik. Top with whipped cream and a cherry. Serve immediately. Delicious Butterfinger candy sprinkled over ice cream and bananas - topped with a rich chocolate. Everyone will be happy!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk mayonnaise, garlic, rosemary, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Spread mayonnaise mixture evenly over each piece of chicken. Spread rice out into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour water over rice. Place chicken pieces on top of rice and top with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 35 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Quick, easy, and gluten-free recipe in less than 1 hour.  This is a modified version of the original mayo chicken recipe on this site.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a large cast iron skillet with cooking spray. Place prepared skillet over medium heat for 30 seconds. Add 1 flour tortilla and cook until bottom is browned and hardened, about 1 minute. Top tortilla with 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, 1/2 of the tomato, 1/2 of the onion, and 1/2 of the bacon; season with salt and pepper. Cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute. Transfer skillet to preheated oven and cook until cheese is completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Top tortilla with 1/2 of the avocado slices, cilantro, salt, and pepper. Drizzle ranch dressing and buffalo ranch dressing in a zig-zag motion over the top. Repeat with remaining ingredients. A quick and easy recipe with bacon, tomatoes, and avocados. A great base to add a variety of toppings and get the kids involved in the kitchen. We love making these for lunch and as appetizers with whatever leftovers we have available; chicken, steak, vegetables. Enjoy!
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the egg noodles, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook the sausages until completely cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Pour the melted butter into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish; layer half of the cooked egg noodles into the bottom of the dish; top with half of the sausage slices and half of the apple slices; sprinkle about half of the cinnamon-sugar mix over the dish. Repeat layers with remaining noodles, sausage, apples, and cinnamon-sugar. Dot with the butter pieces. Bake in the preheated oven until the apples are soft, 30 to 45 minutes. This is more of a dessert than anything. This Pennsylvania-Dutch meal is a favorite at our family potlucks and will fill you up quickly. It also makes great leftovers for lunches.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together oats, flour, and coconut. Stir in oil and water. Press dough into a 9 inch pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 12 minutes, until lightly browned. Has oats and coconut; tastes great with cherry filling.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Stir 3/4 cup water and taco seasoning into ground beef; simmer until water has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir rice in the hot oil until fragrant and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water, salsa, onion, and garlic; bring to a boil. Lower heat, cover skillet, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Stir ground beef mixture into rice mixture. Spoon a layer of ground beef-rice mixture into each bell pepper; top with a layer of Mexican cheese and a layer of nacho cheese-flavored tortilla chips. Repeat layering ingredients into bell peppers, ending with a Mexican cheese layer. Arrange stuffed peppers in a 9x9-inch baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until bell peppers are tender and cheese is lightly browned, about 30 minutes. A new twist to stuffed peppers!
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.  Stir in Italian dressing and green beans.  Cover and cook for 25 minutes, stirring often. Uncover and cook until beans reach desired tenderness. My friend makes this and they are truly the best green beans I have ever had, and very simple.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream together the margarine and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the egg yolks, vanilla and port wine. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Roll the dough into walnut sized balls. Dip each ball in the remaining egg whites. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove from the oven and immediately place 4 or 5 of the chocolate and/or peanut butter chips into the center of each cookie. Return to the oven for 2 more minutes to melt the chips. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. This is a variation of the shortbread cookie, with a few twists. I like to discover new things, and this is definitely worth tasting!
Combine the olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, garlic, onion, salt, pepper, rosemary, steak seasoning, and steak sauce in the container of a food processor or blender. Process until well blended. Prick steaks on both sides with a fork, and place in a shallow container with a lid. Pour marinade over steaks, cover, and refrigerate at least 3 hours, or overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, or light charcoal, and wait until coals are completely white. Soaked wood chips may be added to the coals when ready for a smoky flavor, if you like. Remove steaks from marinade, and discard the marinade. Lightly oil the grilling surface, and place steaks on the grill. Cover, and grill steaks for about 10 minutes on each side, or to your desired degree of doneness. Marinated steaks so tender you can cut with a fork!  Friends and family always come running when they know I'm grilling.
In a large salad bowl, stir together the yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice, dill, capers, shallot, and white vinegar until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Lightly toss cucumbers and tomatoes in the dressing until coated, and very gently stir in the smoked salmon. Refrigerate until serving time. New twist on the traditional cucumber salad. It is a loose recipe that is really easy to make and delicious. You will love the new addition!
Whisk mayonnaise, seasoned salt, and smoked paprika together in a bowl. Stir raisins, water chestnuts, pecans, and green onions into mayonnaise mixture until well-combined; add chicken and stir until completely coated. Season with black pepper. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour. I took a fantastic chicken salad recipe an tweaked it my way - and I'm in love. Wonderful on crackers, bread for sandwiches, or just eat out of the bowl!
Cut chicken into 1-inch-square pieces. In a mixing bowl, combine cornstarch, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sugar, cilantro, ginger and garlic. Add chicken and toss to coat. Refrigerate, covered, at least 30 minutes. Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Fold each piece of foil in half twice to make a 6-inch square. Place a spoonful of chicken in the center of each piece of foil, dividing it equally. Fold foil squares on the diagonal; fold edges to seal. Place on a nonstick baking sheet and bake 20 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in the center. Individual foil packets contain chunks of chicken in a savory soy and hoisin sauce with cilantro and fresh ginger.
Bring the quinoa and chicken broth to a boil in a saucepan; reduce heat to a simmer and cover the pan. Simmer until the broth is absorbed, the quinoa is fluffy, and the white line is visible in the grain, about 12 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet; cook and stir the garlic scapes and onion until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken breast strips and cook until the chicken is still slightly pink in the middle, about 5 more minutes. Remove the chicken meat and set aside. Pour 2 more tablespoons of olive oil in the skillet and cook and stir the zucchini and tomato until the zucchini is tender, 5 to 8 minutes. Return chicken to skillet and sprinkle with feta cheese, basil leaves, and lime juice. Cook until the chicken is fully cooked and hot, about 10 more minutes. Serve over hot quinoa. A quick recipe that can be adjusted to include whatever vegetables you have on hand.  It could probably be done well with shrimp also. You could easily try different vegetables.  The times and amounts are variable depending upon how thick you slice your chicken and veggies, as well as how crisp you prefer the zucchini.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spread pine nuts, hazelnuts, almonds, cashews, and walnuts onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven, stirring occasionally, until nuts are roasted and fragrant, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove nuts from oven and cool slightly. Crush nuts using a rolling pin. Boil chestnuts in a pot of water until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain and finely chop. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute onions and garlic until onions are tender and garlic is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove garlic and stir parsley, salt, and pepper into onion; add mushrooms. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking until mushrooms are softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. Heat butter in a separate large skillet over medium-high heat; saute rice until toasted and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir wine and vegetable stock, 1 cup at a time, into rice, allowing stock to evaporate before each addition until rice is tender and all the liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir mushroom mixture, roasted nuts, and boiled chestnuts into rice mixture and remove from heat. Delicious risotto made with vegetable broth and a variety of nuts. Serve as a side dish or filling main course.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Whisk egg and water together in a small bowl. Combine the pizza sauce and pepperoni in a blender or food processor.  Process until pepperoni is well chopped and the sauce has thickened. Transfer sauce to a large bowl, and stir in mozzarella. Lay out one eggroll wrapper on work surface.  Place 1 tablespoon filling at the bottom center of the wrapper, leaving 1/2 inch border on each side.  Lightly brush the wrapper edges with the egg mixture.  Fold over both sides; roll up to encase filling in wrapper.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Deep fry pizza rolls in batches until crisp and golden brown, 5-9 minutes. This is just the base for a basic pepperoni pizza roll. I made this with leftover pizza toppings.  I didn't feel like making any dough so I substituted egg roll wraps.
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear stew meat in hot skillet to brown on all sides, about 5 minutes. Pour water into skillet. Stir tomato paste and onion soup mix into the water. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and simmer until the beef is tender enough to easily cut with a fork, about 2 hours. A simple yet delicious cold-night favorite.
In a small saucepan, heat clam juice and peeled potatoes. Bring water to a boil and let simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Place bacon in a large stock pot. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Stir in onions and celery. Cook until vegetables are soft. Add potatoes, clam juice and clams to the stock pot. Heat until simmering. In a separate pot, gently warm (do not boil) half and half. Pour warm half and half into the stock pot and heat just until warmed through. Do not boil the chowder or the cream will separate. Serve hot. This is a rich clam chowder, but not as thick and pasty as some. Fresh shucked clams are recommended, but you may also use canned clams.
Lay the chuck roast into the bottom of a slow cooker with a tight-fitting lid. Sprinkle the taco seasoning mix over the beef. Pour the green salsa over the beef, followed by the beef broth. Cook on Low for 4 hours. Add more beef broth if needed. Remove the beef from the slow cooker and shred with two forks. Return the shredded beef to the slow cooker; mix with the liquid. Serve hot. This recipe can be done in the slow cooker or the oven (at 325 degrees F). It is pulled beef taco meat. The leftovers makes superb enchiladas. Spicy and full-bodied flavor without overdone heat.
Bring the barley and water to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 30 minutes, or until tender. Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic until tender. Season with rosemary. Mix the mushrooms, yellow bell pepper, and wine into the pot, and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the cooked barley, beans, tomatoes, and spinach. Season with red pepper flakes. Continue cooking 10 minutes, or until spinach is wilted. This filling vegetarian stew is great year-round. Serve with a dry Chardonnay and crusty bread.
Heat oven to 350Â°F. In small bowl, mix cooking sauce and chiles. Spray bottom of 13x9-inch (3-quart) glass baking dish with cooking spray. Spread 1/4 cup sauce mixture in bottom of baking dish. In medium bowl, stir together chicken, black beans, 1 cup cheese, the sour cream and 1/2 cup sauce mixture. Spoon about 1/2 cup chicken mixture down center of each tortilla. Roll up tortillas; arrange, seam sides down, in baking dish. Top enchiladas with remaining sauce mixture. Sprinkle with remaining cheese. Spray sheet of foil with cooking spray; cover baking dish with foil, sprayed side down. Bake 35 minutes. Remove foil; bake 5 to 10 minutes longer or until hot and cheese is melted. Top with green onions and tomatoes. The cooking sauce is the secret for making these enchiladas super creamy and full of flavor.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until brown and the juices run clear.  Drain and set aside. In a small bowl, combine ricotta, egg, basil, thyme, garlic powder, oregano and half the shredded mozzarella.  Mix well, and set aside. Coat the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish with a little of the spaghetti sauce.  Place three noodles in the bottom of the pan, not touching.  Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture, a layer of sausage, and a layer of spaghetti sauce over the noodles.  Repeat three more times.  Top with the reserved mozzarella and Parmesan.  Cover with foil. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, remove foil and bake 15 minutes more, until golden and bubbly. This lasagna recipe is so easy, even a novice cook could master it!  Even better, it tastes so good, your family will fight over the leftovers.  If there are any!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine cake mix, whipped topping and egg;  mix well.  Mixture will be sticky. Drop 1 inch sized balls of dough into confectioners' sugar; roll slightly to form uniform size balls.    Place on lightly greased baking sheet 2 inches apart. Bake 10-12 minutes.  Remove to racks to cool.  Store in tightly covered container. This recipe makes a soft, chewy cookie that your family will gobble up in a hurry!  There are only four ingredients and I have most of them in my pantry or refrigerator at all times -- no hunting for exotic ingredients!  If chocolate is not your favorite, the recipe can be changed by using a lemon cake mix with the pudding in the mix.  They are great also!
For salsa, gently toss together all ingredients with salt and pepper to taste. Trim salmon into 4-ounce pieces.  Marinate in Kikkoman Teriyaki Takumi Garlic and Green Onion Sauce for about 45 minutes. Preheat your grill for about 10 to 15 minutes. Pat salmon dry, oil grill with olive oil, and grill about 5-7 minutes on each side until cooked through. Top with Avocado and Stone Fruit Salsa. Great easy recipe that is healthy and refreshing!  Use your favorite stone fruit for this salsa!  Any fish that is good for grilling can be substituted for salmon.
Pour the grenadine and lime juice into a tall glass. Pour in the cola to mix. Float a strip of lemon zest on top to garnish. My stepdad and I have a favorite drink that we created, and it's really amazing! It's delicious and fizzy, anyone would love it. Named after the fierce dragon in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, (I know, we're HP freaks) it's great for a non-alcoholic drink at a party!
Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  Saute onions until golden, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, wine, broth, tomato paste, raisins, orange zest, thyme, black pepper and parsley.  Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes, stirring often.  When onions are tender increase the heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Worth the time it takes to prepare.  Nice for a dinner party.
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add potato, onion, and garlic to the hot oil, reduce heat to medium-low, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Place a lid on the saucepan and cook the mixture at a simmer, stirring occasionally, until the onion and potato soften, 5 to 7 minutes. Season the potato mixture with salt and black pepper. Stir flour into the mixture to make a roux. Increase heat to medium and stir the mixture constantly to cook the flour, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour reserved oyster liquid into the potato mixture. Increase heat to medium-high. Slowly stream skim milk into the saucepan while stirring continually; cook and stir until the mixture begins to thicken and bubble, 5 to 7 minutes. Season again with salt and black pepper as needed. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add oysters to the saucepan; continue to cook and stir until the mixture is thick and the oysters are just cooked through, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and continue to stir until you are sure soup will not boil after covered. Cover and let stand 10 minutes for the flavors to blend. This recipe was originally a higher-fat recipe. But with age and ailments comes restraint and tradeoffs. To try the original recipe, use butter instead of extra-virgin olive oil and whole milk instead of skim. I am not much of a celery fan, especially in mild-flavored foods, but if you like celery, add small diced celery to taste along with the onion, garlic and potato. Serve with crackers of choice. I personally don't use crackers. I feel they detract from enjoying the mild desired flavor and creamy dreaminess.
Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Place the cubed potatoes, water, lemon juice, vegetable oil, and olive oil in a 12x18 inch baking dish or roasting pan. Season with oregano, salt, pepper, and garlic. Roast, uncovered, in the preheated oven until the potatoes are tender and golden brown and the water has evaporated, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir the potatoes every 20 minutes as they bake, adding more water as necessary to prevent sticking. Allow the water to evaporate during the final 15 to 20 minutes of cooking, but be careful that the potatoes do not burn. Stir in the chopped fresh parsley, and serve. My mother made a version of these when I was growing up. Just the smell alone of these garlicky lemon potatoes is comforting.
Place the cubed pumpkin and orange juice in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-low heat. Simmer the pumpkin for 10 to 15 minutes, until it is soft. Carefully transfer to a blender, in batches if necessary, and blend until smooth. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion, garlic, chile, turmeric, cumin, nutmeg, and coriander for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the ham, and cook and stir for about 5 minutes, until the ham has started to brown. Pour the pureed pumpkin mixture into the spicy ham mixture, and stir the peanut butter into the sauce. Mix well to combine, and bring back to a simmer. Serve hot. A different idea to go with boiled rice, steamed couscous, or boiled pasta. Perfect for potluck dinners.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x11 inch casserole with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine bread cubes, 1 cup sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Mix in raisins, if desired. In another bowl, blend milk, melted butter, and eggs.  Add wet ingredients to dry, and mix together without turning bread mixture into mush. Pour mixture into prepared casserole dish. Place casserole dish into a larger baking pan. Pour hot water into baking pan about 1/3 up the side of the casserole dish, creating a water bath.  Bake for 45 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, 1 cup hot water, 2 tablespoons butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Cook on medium heat until bubbling and thickened. Stir constantly to avoid scorching. Serve with bread pudding. This recipe includes directions for making lemon sauce, a perfect complement to a spicy bread pudding.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square pan. Mix graham cracker crumbs, sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut, and butter in a bowl; press into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Pour confectioners' sugar into a shallow bowl. While still warm, shape mixture into 1-inch balls and roll in confectioners' sugar. This is one of my family's favorite sweets, passed down from Aunt Sheryl. They're like a hello dolly or magic bar rolled up into a ball! My kids help me make them, especially if I let them eat a couple while they're still warm! We make them several times during the holidays and throughout the year, and they usually bring in quite a bit of money in our student ministry's dessert auction at church!
Prepare and bake cake mix according to package directions for a 9x13 inch pan. When done, allow cake to cool and leave in pan. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large saucepan, combine brown sugar, flour, butter and egg. Cook over low heat for 3 minutes, or until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in pecans and vanilla. Spread over cake. Place in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes. This store-bought cake mix is topped with a delicious home-made praline 'frosting' that caramelizes after a few minutes in the oven.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Mix butter, brown sugar, and maple extract together in a bowl until smooth. Add flour; stir to combine. Fold in toffee bits.

Cover pot and bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about 45 minutes. Remove pot from heat and stir mint into barley pilaf. Cover pot and allow flavors to blend, 5 to 10 minutes. Served warm or cold, this is a flavorful side dish with chewy barley and tender crisp carrots.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add sweet potato pieces, and boil until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Drain and run cold water over the sweet potatoes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; stir in garlic and sweet potato fries. Place a lid over the skillet and let fries steam for about 5 minutes. Remove lid and sprinkle sweet potatoes with paprika, chili powder,  and seafood seasoning. Continue to fry sweet potatoes, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 10 more minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. A zesty solution for the sweet potato! Dip in chipotle mayonnaise for extra flavor.
Wash and dry catfish filets. Place filets in a shallow dish and pour milk over them. Cover and refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, cheese, Italian seasoning, baking powder, garlic powder, dry mustard, onion powder, salt and pepper. Dredge filets in flour mixture. Lightly grease a rimmed baking sheet and place coated filets in pan. Drizzle melted butter over filets. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or until firm and flaky.  Serve hot. Easy and delicious baked catfish. The key is to marinate the filets overnight.

Cool slightly; remove from cookie sheet. Peanut butter cookies topped with miniature chocolate peanut butter cup candy.  You may need a few more or less peanut butter cups depending on how many cookies you make out of a batch of dough.
Place pork tenderloin in a slow cooker with the contents of the soup packet. Pour water, wine, and soy sauce over the top, turning the pork to coat.

Place ice cubes into a 2 quart pitcher. Place the lavender into a bowl, and pour boiling water over it. Allow to steep for about 10 minutes, then strain out the lavender and discard. Mix the sugar into the hot lavender water, then pour into the pitcher with the ice. Squeeze the juice from the lemons into the pitcher, getting as much juice as you can. Top off the pitcher with cold water, and stir. Taste, and adjust lemon juice or sugar if desired. Pour into tall glasses, pull up a lawn chair and a good book, and relax! This is a fabulous summer drink! Lavender soothes and refreshes on a hot day, and the scent brings back fond summer memories.  I can't seem to make enough of it for my family.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round baking pans. Beat 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs, one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon lemon peel, mixing well. Combine 2 cups flour, baking powder, and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Pour flour mixture into the batter alternately with 1 cup eggnog, mixing until just incorporated. Stir in bourbon. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until cake springs back when touched lightly with a fingertip or a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes (test both cake layers). Cool in pans for 10 minutes before inverting on a wire rack to cool completely. To make frosting, combine 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a saucepan. Gradually whisk in 1 1/2 cups eggnog, whisking until smooth. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently. When mixture boils, cook for 2 minutes, whisking constantly, until thickened.

Mix in cooled eggnog mixture, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, rum extract, and 1/8 teaspoon grated lemon peel. Beat on high speed until mixture is fully incorporated and frosting is fluffy. Spread cake with plain frosting between cake layers, over the top and on the sides. Coat the sides with toasted pecans, pressing the nuts onto sides in small handfuls. Refrigerate until serving time. You can really taste the eggnog in this lovely, rich, moist cake. No eggnog? No problem. You can make enough for the recipe in a jiffy. Nothing says Southern hospitality like this impressive cake. If you like, set aside and tint 1/4 cup of the frosting to your desired shade for decorating the top.

Reduce heat to low. Stir the Parmesan cheese and rosemary through the mixture; continue cooking until the cheese is completely melted, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper to serve. A creamy spicy alfredo, great for a dipping sauce!
Fill an old fashioned-type cocktail glass with ice. Pour strawberry vodka, coconut rum, and cranberry juice cocktail over the ice; top off with lemon-lime soda. Squeeze lime into cocktail, stir, and serve. When people tell the bartender at Renee's Courtyard Cafe in Santa Monica, 'make me a drink, surprise me,' this is often the one they make. It's fruity, sweet, and tasty.
In a blender, combine the basil, garlic, cheese and vinegar.  Slowly blend in the oil.  Add salt and pepper to taste. This dressing is great with artichoke and asparagus salad, and it's one of the easiest recipes I have!  Using a good quality olive oil makes a big difference in this dressing.
Mix the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, baking powder, and pepper together in a bowl. Place the potatoes and onion in a large bowl, and stir in the flour mixture until thoroughly blended. Use floured hands to knead the potato mixture in the bowl until it takes on the quality of stiff bread dough. Add additional flour if the dough is too sticky. Pinch off a tennis ball-sized piece of dough and shape it around a cube of ham, completely covering the ham, to form a ball. Repeat with remaining dough and ham cubes. Set aside any extra ham. Fill a large pot with water, add 2 teaspoons salt and any extra ham, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Carefully slide the balls into the boiling water, a few at a time. Loosen any sticking to the bottom of the pot. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on a plate. Serve hot with melted butter. This is a traditional Norwegian main dish. My grandmother always served it with fresh peas. As good as the potato klubb are the first day, they're even better the second day sliced and fried in butter until golden brown. We like to have them for breakfast with fried eggs.

Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Combine first 4 ingredients. Place 1 won ton wrapper in each of 12 muffin pan cups sprayed with cooking spray, extending edges of wrapper over rim of cup. Fill with crab mixture. Bake 18 to 20 min. or until edges of cups are golden brown and filling is heated through. What's old is new again, and so's this classic appetizer. Crispy won ton wrappers hold a creamy mixture of crab meat for a better-for-you bite that will never go out of style.
Place pinto beans and garbanzo beans in a medium sized stock pot with water.  Cook for 5 minutes over medium-high heat and then add chicken bouillon granules. Mix well and add hot pepper sauce.

Blend strawberries, milk, peanut butter, oats, and honey together in a blender until smooth. This is a favorite breakfast at our house on busy days when I can't cook a full meal. It is also nice for a an easy snack in the afternoons.
Whisk the vegetable oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic, and pepper together in a bowl until combined. To use the marinade, place the meat in the bag, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours. Discard the marinade after it has been used. This was one of my grandfather's favorite recipes. It's so simple, the family loves it, and it's a wonderful recipe for a great barbeque meal!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. In a shallow, medium bowl, mix cayenne pepper, lemon pepper, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Brush both sides of catfish fillets with butter. Rub fillets with the cayenne pepper mixture on both sides. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat until really hot. Add fillets, and fry approximately 2 minutes on each side, until slightly blackened. Arrange blackened fillets in a single layer in the prepared baking dish, and coat with Italian-style salad dressing. Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Cajun catfish served up with just the right touch of spices and flavor.

Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Spread chopped hazelnuts in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring once or twice, and watching very carefully as they will burn very easily. Remove from the oven when browned and fragrant. Cut baby carrots in half cross-wise. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring water, carrots, salt, and 1 tablespoon of butter. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Cover, and simmer very lightly for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender but firm. Drain and set aside. Return pan to the stove over medium heat, and melt the remaining 2 tablespoons  of butter. Cook shallots in the melted butter, stirring occasionally, until translucent. Add Marsala and sugar, and stir continually until sugar is completely dissolved. Continue simmering until sauce has thickened slightly. Once thickened, toss carrots and hazelnuts with the sauce until well coated. Garnish with parsley, if desired. Serve immediately. This incredible carrot dish is like no other you've ever tasted! Elegant for any holiday or special occasion, yet easy enough for any day of the week. Please DO NOT omit the Marsala wine as it makes this dish taste spectacular.
Combine the 5 tablespoons sugar, butter, egg yolks, and sour cream in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade and process well. Add the flour and yeast and process until the dough comes together. If the dough feels too wet, add a little more flour; if it's too dry, add milk a tablespoon at a time. The dough should be moist and easy to work with. Shape the dough into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and set aside. To make the filling, heat the milk and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves and the mixture has a syrupy consistency. Add the chopped walnuts and stir to combine. Remove the saucepan from the heat; stir in the lemon zest and raisins, and let filling cool. Divide the dough into three pieces. Roll one piece of dough out on a lightly floured surface to form a long rectangle about a 1/4-inch thick; keep the remaining dough covered. Spread 1/3 of the walnut filling on the dough, leaving about an inch of dough at each edge. Roll the dough up to form a log, and press to seal. Place the dough, seam-side down, on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make an egg wash. Brush the loaves with egg wash and let rest for 1 hour in a warm place. After the dough has risen, brush it again with egg wash and put the baking tray in the refrigerator for 30 minutes (this will give the dough a shiny finish). Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake the loaves until they're a deep golden brown, about 35 to 45 minutes. This is a traditional walnut roll which is served in many Hungarian families at Christmas and Easter as a special treat.  This recipe has been handed down in my family for generations. The preparation takes time, plus the dough needs an hour and 30 minutes of resting time, but the result is well worth the effort!
Bring rice and water to a boil in a pot. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 20 minutes, or until rice is tender and water has been absorbed. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the tofu in the oil until browned, about 10 minutes. Add the onion and garlic; cook and stir until the onion is translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in the tomato paste and peanut butter; cook and stir until peanut butter has melted completely, about 5 minutes. Serve over cooked rice. This combination of tomato paste, peanut butter, onion, garlic, and tofu may seem odd, but it is delicious. Give it a try!
Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a rolling pin until they are coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well. Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredge chicken pieces in egg, then place in bag with crumb mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. A fun chicken recipe the kids can help prepare. They love crushing the crackers. It does not matter if the measurements aren't perfect, just wing it!

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, toss bread crumbs together with kelp powder, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, and salt. Dip tofu slices into olive oil, then bread crumb mixture, patting lightly to coat well. Bake on a cookie sheet in preheated oven for 30 minutes. When first side is golden brown and slightly crispy, turn over, and finish baking. Meanwhile, mix together mayonnaise, relish, and lemon juice until well-blended. When tofu is nearly done baking, brush each bun half with olive oil, and toast in the oven. Serve with tartar sauce and your favorite sandwich condiments. If you are a vegetarian who doesn't eat fish, yet still have that hankering for a juicy fish sandwich, these bread crumb-crusted tofu 'fish' sandwiches will blow your mind!

Blend cranberry juice, raspberries, strawberries, yogurt, and protein powder in a blender until it is your desired consistency; pour into 2 glasses. Garnish each with a strawberry. I like starting my day with a smoothie and only had cranberry juice one morning. I personally dislike the taste of cranberry juice, but need the health benefits. Cranberry juice reportedly helps prevent UTIs and the formation of kidney stones, and is also full of phytochemicals, which are possible cancer deterrents. It turned delicious. I can finally get my cranberry juice fix and enjoy it at the same time.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the corn and cook until slightly soft but still crisp, about 5 minutes. Cut corn kernels from the cobs; discard cobs.

Pour corn-potato mixture into a large bowl. Add bacon, red onion, cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes; toss to combine. This is a great recipe that I've modified over the years. The flavors are terrific and the ingredients and ratios are very flexible. Adapt to make it your own specialty. Great for picnics and pot lucks. This recipe is very flexible. It is a great, clean-out-the-refrigerator kind of dish. It also stores well and actually tastes better the next day. Serve warm or chilled.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.

Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Stir oats into boiling water and cook at a boil until the mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Season oats mixture with salt; stir. Reduce heat to low and simmer oats until beginning to soften, about 20 minutes. Stir milk, brown sugar, melted butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl with a whisk until smooth; stir into the oats mixture. Continue cooking the oats until tender, 10 to 15 minutes more. Stir cranberries into the oatmeal to distribute throughout the mixture; cook just until the berries are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. I love instant oatmeal 'raisins and spice' flavor, but I wanted better oats, so this is my own twist.   This recipe is not 'quick,' but if you make this large amount, you can refrigerate in small storage containers for a quick and easy snack or meal. This oatmeal taste great hot but even tastes good cold when you are on the go.
To make the dressing, whisk together the ginger root, rice vinegar, orange juice, vegetable oil, sesame oil, soup mix, sugar, and garlic until well blended. Cover, and refrigerate until needed.

To make the salad, toss the cucumber, bell pepper, onion, tomatoes, carrot, spinach, mandarin oranges, chicken, and almonds with the pasta. Pour the dressing over the salad mixture, and toss again to coat evenly. Serve immediately. I had this at a party and couldn't get it off my mind. It's a fruity Asian chicken salad that even my family's picky eaters enjoy. I bake my own chicken for more flavor, which adds to the prep time, but pre-cooked or canned chicken will also work just fine.
Cream together the shortening and the butter, add the almond extract and beat until fluffy. Beat in the confectioners' sugar, one cup at a time. Add the milk alternately with the confectioners' sugar, one tablespoon at a time until the icing reaches the desired consistency. Color and decorate as desired. Light almond flavored icing, great for sugar and butter cookies.  You may need as little as 4 cups of confectioners' sugar; just stop adding it when you've reached the desired consistency.

Chill the bottle of red wine, lemon-lime soda, and orange juice at the same time. Gently crush the fruits with a spoon, then stir in the red wine, lemon-lime soda, and orange juice.  Add additional brandy or orange juice to taste. I found a good sangria recipe and headed to the liquor store to purchase the alcohol. In line, ahead of me, was a man who said he has been a bartender for twenty years now, and that the recipe needed a few touch-ups if I wanted to make it like the Pros. So, here is what he professed to me, muchos thanks to the other submitters for their delicious versions.

Can be made chunky by adding diced carrot, potato and shredded cabbage to the veggie list.
Mix figs, sugar, lemon slices, and strawberry gelatin in a large pot. Let stand for 1 hour. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat, stirring often to prevent burning, until foam has disappeared and the preserves are thickened, 25 to 40 minutes. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the fig preserves into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 2 days before opening. Many times people mistake my fig preserves for strawberry or blackberry jam. It is so easy to do, and my kids love the twist on the sometimes-boring fig preserves.
Place the potatoes and cauliflower into a pot, then pour in the chicken broth. Add water to nearly cover the vegetables; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender, about 20 minutes. Drain the potatoes and cauliflower, but keep about 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid. Separate the cooked potatoes into a large bowl. Transfer the cauliflower into a blender or food processor along with about 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid, and pulse until the cauliflower is thoroughly pureed. Spoon the blended cauliflower into the bowl with the potatoes, and mash together until the cauliflower and potatoes form a smooth, white mixture. Season the mixture with salt and black pepper. For a softer topping, stir in a few more spoonfuls of the cooking liquid. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x12-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and carrots until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes; stir in the ground turkey, and cook until the meat is no longer pink, breaking it up into small chunks as it cooks. Stir in peas and Worcestershire sauce, then cook until the meat has begun to brown, about 10 more minutes. If the filling mixture starts to look dried out, stir in a few spoonfuls of the cauliflower cooking liquid to keep it moist. Place the filling into the prepared baking dish, then smooth it out into an even layer. Top the filling with the mashed potato and cauliflower mixture, and spread with a fork, leaving little peaks and swirls in the topping. Bake the pie in the preheated oven until the filling is bubbling, about 25 minutes. Turn on the oven's broiler, and broil the pie about 6 inches from the heat source until the mashed topping has browned, about 10 more minutes. A bit of a twist on the old Irish recipe. Loaded with a few extra vegetables, this went well with a side of bread. My husband liked it, my toddler was too interested in the bread...
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add farfalle pasta, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Place a separate pan of water on to boil.

Here's my version of Brazilian-Style Beef Ribs, enjoy!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 6 4-inch tart pans with butter, then dust with flour. In a bowl, stir 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar and ground almonds together until well combined. Mix in the flour, then stir in the unsalted butter and egg. Mix a few times until the dough is smooth and pliable, then form into a ball and place into the freezer for about 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 6 pieces, then roll each piece out to a circle about 5 inches in diameter. Pat the dough into the prepared tart pans; place parchment paper on top of the dough. Place several tablespoons of dried beans or pie weights into the bottom of each shell. Bake the tart shells in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Set the shells aside in their pans to cool on a rack. Remove and discard paper; save beans or pie weights for other baking use. In a bowl, whisk together the mascarpone cheese, yogurt, 4 1/2 tablespoons of confectioners' sugar, and scraped vanilla beans until the mixture is thick and smooth. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of mascarpone filling into each cooled tart shell; arrange raspberries on top of the filling in an attractive low mound. Sprinkle each tart with pistachios. Refrigerate at least 15 minutes before serving. Crispy and yummy: the perfect ending to a summer meal!

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut slits in the top of the leg of lamb every 3 to 4 inches, deep enough to push slices of garlic down into the meat. Salt and pepper generously all over the top of lamb, place several sprigs of fresh rosemary under and on top of the lamb. Place lamb on roasting pan. Roast in preheated oven until the lamb is cooked to your desired doneness, about 1 3/4 to 2 hours. Do not overcook the lamb, the flavor is best if meat is still slightly pink. Let rest at least 10 minutes before carving. Cooking peeled potatoes in the pan around the roast is yummy. The only other things you need are gravy made from the pan drippings and a fresh vegetable.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch tube pan and one 9x5 inch loaf pan. Sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and cloves into a large bowl. Stir in the applesauce and oil, then mix in the raisins, dates, mixed fruit and 2 cups of walnuts. Pour into the prepared pans. Pans should be about 3/4 full if using mini pans, or an assortment. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the crown of the cake comes out clean. My grandmother and mother made these cakes for years. They are moist but don't contain eggs. Applesauce is the secret ingredient. I sold these at bake sales for years and we had many customers who returned every year just to get one.
In large bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups flour and yeast. Mix water, 3 tablespoons sugar and salt together, and add to the dry ingredients.

Chowders always bring to mind a picture of a cozy, kicked-back, winter-time family meal; cuddled up around a roaring fireplace with plenty of warm food, good cheer and loving friends. This one is a Sunday night family favorite - easy on the cook (and the cook's pocketbook), yet sure to bring raves from the hubby and kids. Enjoy!
Dissolve the salt in the water, and add the cucumber, onions and cauliflower. Cover and leave for 24 hours.  Drain the vegetables.

Add more boiling water to cover them, about 2 inches above the tops.  Bring to a boil and cover, processing for 15 minutes. Remove jars from pot. Put jars on a wood or cloth surface, several inches apart and allow to cool. Jars will be sealed. Growing up in England, Piccalilli was commercially available, but none were as good as my grandmother's recipe. This was always a favorite with cheese. It is a good relish to have on hand and would be tasty in a ham sandwich.

An authentic Mexican salsa made with tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos. Serve with tacos, nachos, tortilla chips, black beans, refried beans, or fajitas or use as an ingredient in many Mexican recipes. My family uses it as a side in which to dip grilled steak. If you like it hot, then this is for you; this pico is not for the faint of heart. It is very hot, which most people in my circle like. If you don't like highly spicy dishes, you might might want to try something less spicy or cut down the jalapeno and use a type pepper that is more to your taste.
In a large pot of salted water boil pasta shells until al dente. Drain well and rinse. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (175 degrees C). In  medium bowl, combine spinach, mozzarella cheese, cottage cheese, egg white, parmesan cheese, nutmeg, and Italian seasoning until blended. Fill each pasta shell with a heaping tablespoon of spinach mixture. Pour 1 cup spaghetti sauce into a 8x12 inch baking dish, spread evenly. Place shells in pan. Spoon remaining spaghetti sauce over shells. Cover with aluminum foil and bake  for 30 to 40 minutes, or until shells are heated through. Large pasta shells stuffed with lowfat cheeses and spinach, smothered in marinara sauce and baked. You can use 2 tablespoons egg substitute in place of the egg white if you prefer. Lighten it up even more by using nonfat cottage cheese.

Mix onion mixture, tomatoes with green chiles, bacon, and andouille sausage into pea mixture. Season with sugar, salt, and pepper. Simmer pea mixture until flavors have blended, 1 1/2 hours. This is my own variation on the traditional New Year's meal, but really takes it up a notch. I usually end up making it a lot each winter. If word gets out to friends that I'm making this, I don't have leftovers. Serve with corn bread. I sometimes use some of the hog jowl instead of bacon. Slice it thin and then chop into small pieces, and just leave it in the pan while cooking the Trinity (onion, celery, and bell pepper).
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in melted butter until the onion is golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.

She even used food coloring for the different designs, like green trees, etc.The kids love to decorate them as much as they love to eat them.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the shortening with the sugars and the peanut butter until well mixed. Beat in the egg and the water. Gradually beat in the flour, baking soda and salt. Form cookies on an ungreased baking sheet with a cookie press or roll into balls and smash flat with a floured fork or fingers. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 12 minutes or more until done, usually when the puffed up cookie has lowered down to level. Before then it is more chewy. For High Altitude, omit water and add eggs last, mixing well, but not beating them  as at sea level. Raise the temperature to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C). Or use a convection oven at 312 degrees F (155 degrees C) for 15 min works even better. These Peanut Butter cookies are NOT chewy, they are melt-in-your mouth. The water in them lets you put them in your cookie press.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat.

Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 20 minutes. I'm not going to lie, my Chocolate Chip Cookie Cupcakes are still my favorite, but these are a VERY close second AND you don't have to wait for anything to freeze so they provide almost instant gratification, which makes me happy.  Instantly. The very center of the brownie layer remains slightly gooey to give you that decadent brownie indulgence!
Place chicken thighs in a shallow baking dish. Pour vinegar over, cover and let marinate overnight. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Cook and stir sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat until mixture turns light brown and syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove syrup from heat; fold in pine nuts to coat. Add Parmesan cheese; stir to coat. Line baking sheet with waxed paper; spread coated pine nuts onto sheet, separating any bunches. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. I recently visited a fancy restaurant that served Parmesan encrusted pine nuts in their Caesar salad. This is my near-perfect attempt to replicate these delicious salad toppers. The salad consisted of romaine lettuce, shredded Parmesan cheese, dressing, mixed croutons, and these pine nuts. They are sweet, savory, nutty, and delicious.
Cut each potato into wedges by quartering the potatoes, then cutting each quarter in half. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat in a large skillet, and cook and stir the onion and mushrooms until the mushrooms start to release their liquid and the onion becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the onion and mushrooms into a bowl, and set aside. Heat 2 more tablespoons of olive oil over high heat in the same skillet, and place the potato wedges into the hot oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and allow to cook, stirring occasionally, until the wedges are browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, sprinkle the potato wedges with red pepper flakes, and allow to cook until the potatoes are tender, about 10 more minutes. Stir in the onion and mushroom mixture, toss the vegetables together, and mix in the capers and fresh tarragon. This is a simple side dish for purple potatoes, onions and mushrooms. You can prepare this recipe in a large skillet. I prefer thoroughly scrubbing the potatoes and not peeling them.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut each slice of white bread in half horizontally. Spread with cream cheese. Tightly roll each piece of bread with half a piece of bacon. The bacon should be on the outside of the bread. Secure with toothpicks. Arrange roll ups in a single layer on a medium baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until bacon is no longer pink and bread is lightly browned. Serve warm. I was given this recipe at a party a long time ago by the hostess. It is a really easy appetizer to make and always the first one to disappear. Toothpicks are necessary to secure these little roll ups.
In a medium saucepan, combine water, brown sugar, cinnamon, and syrup. Heat mixture to a boil. When water is at a boil, reduce heat and add in oats.

This creamy oatmeal is perfect for those cozy winter mornings with a good cup of coffee.  Or serve it to your kids with some hot chocolate.  Not too sweet, not too bland, and it has fresh fruit!
Beat the egg and vinegar together in a small bowl, and set aside. Whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in the cold butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. (This can also be done in a food processor: pulse the cold butter or shortening until it's the size of small peas. Turn mixture into a bowl and proceed.) Stir in the egg and vinegar mixture. Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until the flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or up to three days. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll one ball out to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate and chill for at least 20 minutes before baking. Roll out top crust and set aside. Arrange the apple slices on the bottom of the pie crust, then scatter the blackberries on top. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup sugar. Place the second pie crust on top of the fruit mixture, and pinch the top and bottom crusts together. Lightly sprinkle the top crust with water, followed by the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar. Poke several holes in the top of the crust with a fork to allow steam to escape during baking. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. I know apples in a blackberry pie seem a little weird but my grandma swears they soak up the juice and now I can't enjoy a blackberry pie without them.

Cook until golden brown, then turn over and cook until browned on the skin side; remove and keep warm. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Crack four of the eggs into the hot pan, and cook until the egg whites have firmed about halfway through, about 1 minute. Gently flip the eggs over, and cook 10 to 20 seconds more until the other side has just firmed on the outside. Repeat with the remaining eggs. To assemble, place two biscuit halves onto each plate, cut-side-up. Divide the andouille sausage among the biscuits, then top each biscuit with an egg. Finally, spoon some of the sauce over each egg and serve. Forget the English muffins, Canadian bacon, poaching eggs and harassing Hollandaise sauce.  This biscuit, egg, and andouille sausage breakfast topped with a simple Mornay sauce is terrific.

I love the tangy taste of fried green tomatoes, but they are, well...fried! And messy to make. I developed this recipe to help assuage my hunger for fried green tomatoes, and yes, it does the job quite well. Without all the grease and batter, the tangy taste of the tomato can really shine through!
Mix apples, water, lemon juice, and agave nectar in a pot over medium heat; season with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and black pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring frequently, and cook until the apples soften, about 15 minutes. Use a potato masher or a large fork to mash apples to desired consistency. Remove pot from heat and allow applesauce to cool. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate until cold. This spiced applesauce is an amazing way to start the morning. I love it by itself or as a healthy topping for oatmeal, yogurt, or cottage cheese. I try to eat gluten- and sugar-free food as much as possible while keeping it delicious and full of flavor. This simple recipe is an easy choice! Agave nectar is a fantastic natural sweetener that is low carb and low glycemic index. It is about twice as sweet as sugar so use it in moderation. Use twice the amount of sugar if you are going to substitute. I like my apples tart, so feel free to sweeten to taste.

Place a single basil leaf on top of the cream cheese and press down slightly so basil adheres to cheese. Top with a thin slice of capicola. Easy, delicious appetizer using spicy, capicola ham.  Make sure you use fresh basil, as the flavors will not be the same if you use dried.  These can be made ahead of time and refrigerated, but be sure to bring them up to room temperature before serving to blend the flavors.

Place mushrooms, hollow sides up, on a baking sheet; brush the insides with melted butter. Chop mushroom stems; cook and stir chopped stems, black olives, green onion, and crumbled bacon in the bacon drippings over medium heat until mushroom stems release their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper; stir to coat. Tilt the skillet slightly; move vegetable-bacon mixture to one side, allowing the bacon drippings to pool to the other side. Whisk flour into bacon drippings until smooth and paste-like; slowly stir in milk until gravy is smooth. Mix vegetable-bacon mixture into the gravy. Add American cheese and Parmesan cheese; cook and stir until  cheeses melt, about 5 minutes. Spoon filling into mushroom caps.

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. When hot, lightly oil grate. Mix together the ground beef, 2 tablespoons barbeque seasoning, and chipotle peppers in adobo sauce in a bowl; divide mixture into two halves; form each half into large rectangles, making one larger and thinner than the other; lay the rectangles on large sheets of aluminum foil. Mix together the cream cheese and 1 teaspoon barbeque seasoning; spread on top of the smaller, thicker rectangle of meat. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in the hot butter until the onion has softened; spread atop the cream cheese mixture; top with the Cheddar cheese. Place the thinner rectangle of meat atop the smaller piece by lifting the aluminum foil beneath it and flipping it onto the cream cheese and vegetable layer. Use your hands to form a seal around the edges of the loaf, making sure the cheese and vegetable mixture will not leak out during cooking. Fold the edges of the aluminum foil beneath the loaf upwards, so as to form a bowl, to keep the grease from leaking onto the grill while cooking. Brush the top of the loaf with barbeque sauce. Cook on the preheated grill until the top of the loaf is cooked completely through, about 30 minutes. Slice into six even pieces to serve. This scrumptious stuffed-and-grilled meatloaf has sauteed vegetables and is oozing with a full, robust flavor.
Place 1 cup milk in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until bubbling, about 2 minutes. Stir in the oats. Mix flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Whisk eggs, 2 teaspoons melted butter, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; add 1/4 cup milk. Mix oat mixture and egg mixture with flour mixture; stir to combine. Heat 2 teaspoons butter on a griddle or skillet over medium heat; pour about 1/3 cup batter into the hot butter. Cook pancakes until bubbles appear on top layer, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook other side until evenly browned, about 5 more minutes. My husband used to not like pancakes and absolutely hate pancake syrup until I had him try the oatmeal pancake with mango or blueberry sauce. Now he regularly asks me to make some for breakfast. Serve warm with your favorite syrup or sauce.
Place whole, peeled carrots onto smoker rack. Smoke 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Heat vegetable oil in a 1 1/2 to 2 gallon soup pot over medium heat. Stir in onions, jalapeno pepper, and garlic, cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Chop carrots, and add to onions along with celery; continue cooking another 5 to 10 minutes until the celery softens. Stir in turmeric and curry powder until evenly distributed; pour in vegetable stock. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. Strain the vegetables out of the soup and puree in a blender until smooth. Pour the puree back into the soup, and continue simmering 30 minutes more. Whisk butter into soup until melted, then stir in cream, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Strain soup through a fine mesh strainer before serving. This is both popular with both vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Coat a 12 cup muffin pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, prepare muffin batter as directed. Fold in the ham, cheese, and chives or scallions. Spoon the batter into the prepared cups, filling each three-quarter full. Bake the muffins until their tops are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Let them cool in the pan on a wire rack for 3 minutes, then turn them out onto the rack and let them cool completely. The muffins can be frozen in a plastic freezer bag for up to three months. Corn muffins with diced ham, Cheddar cheese and chives make a great brunch treat or a side with chili or stew.
Melt 1/2 cup butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally and cook until the milk solids turn brown and give off a nutty fragrance, 15 to 20 minutes. Combine the remaining 1/4 butter and cream cheese in a mixing bowl. Pour the browned butter into the mixing bowl and set aside for about three minutes, letting the warm butter soften the cream cheese and cold butter. Scrape the black seeds from the vanilla bean and add them to the bowl. Add the bourbon and mix on low speed until smooth. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar and cream, alternating between the two, until the proper consistency is reached. If the frosting is too soft for decorating, refrigerate it for about half an hour before using. This frosting pairs perfectly with banana, carrot, and spice cakes. Browning the butter gives it a deep, nutty flavor. As with many buttercreams, you may need slightly more or less sugar to reach your desired consistency.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute chicken breasts for 4 to 5 minutes each side, or until white. Add pepper, garlic, onion and broth.

Spread a thin layer of marinara sauce in the bottom of a deep 11x15-inch baking dish; top with a layer of moistened matzah sheets, breaking pieces as needed to completely cover marinara. Spread a layer of ricotta mixture over matzah mixture. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over ricotta mixture layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of matzah, marinara, and mozzarella cheese, respectively. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and browned, about 45 minutes. This is a 'dairy' main meal for Passover that re-heats well. Even the pickiest eaters love this recipe. Vegetables like mushrooms, zucchini, and peppers may be added; steam them al dente first and add to layers. Italian cheese blend can be used in place of mozzarella if desired.
Stir the stock, cornstarch, brown sugar, ketchup and vinegar in a 1-quart saucepan until the mixture is smooth.  Cook and stir over medium-high heat until the mixture boils and thickens. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Thread alternately the pork, mushrooms and onion onto 4 skewers. Lightly oil the grill rack and heat the grill to medium.  Grill the kabobs for 20 minutes or until the pork is cooked through, turning and brushing often with the stock mixture. Place 1 tomato onto the end of each skewer. Heat the remaining stock mixture over medium heat to a boil. Serve with the kabobs and rice. Grilled pork and vegetable kabobs are basted with a savory sauce combining Swanson® Chicken Stock, garlic, ketchup, vinegar and brown sugar.
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Stir green bell pepper and onion together in the bottom of a 9-inch casserole dish. Drizzle olive oil over the vegetables; stir to coat. Coat chicken breasts completely with a thin layer of hummus and place atop the vegetables. Drizzle lemon juice over the chicken and dust with paprika. Cook chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). This is a fast, delicious weeknight dinner. Use any flavor of hummus that you prefer, but spicy works well for me. Serve with a side of rice.
In a saucepan, combine the brown sugar, white sugar, water, cream of tarter and vinegar. Bring to a boil and cook to soft ball stage, 236 degrees F (113 degrees C). In a large, deep mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Slowly pour the sugar mixture into the egg whites while beating constantly. Add vanilla and beat until thick and creamy. This cooked icing is wonderful served over slices of homemade gingerbread.
Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and tomato; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the green chile; cook for 2 minutes then stir in the cheese and milk.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring frequently, until the cheese has melted. This is a true chile con queso that can be eaten with tostadas or in a warm corn tortilla. This is not like the Americanized version of chili con queso that we have become used to that is a cheese dip, which I also love. This is the way my grandma used to make it. The great thing about this recipe is you can play with it and adjust it to your personal taste. If you like it cheesier add more cheese. You can't mess this up unless you burn it.
Mix lemon juice, vinegar, mustard and a big pinch of salt and pepper to taste in a 1-quart Pyrex measuring cup. Add capers and onion; toss to coat. Slowly add oil, pushing onion aside and beating with a small whisk or fork to form a thick dressing. Mix watercress and half the salmon in a large bowl. When ready to serve, pour dressing over watercress and salmon; toss to coat. Arrange on salad plates, garnishing each with remaining smoked salmon. Start with a salad of smoked salmon and watercress. Try to buy the commercial bagged watercress that already has been cleaned to speed things along, or you may substitute other mixed salad greens. (I like to make sure there are some bitter ones, such as radicchio and arugula, along with milder greens, such as butter lettuce or baby spinach.) Also, because this is such a simple salad, all the ingredients should be top-quality. So spring for the best smoked salmon you can find.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil, and cook the linguine 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over high heat, and cook and stir the chorizo sausage 2-3 minutes, until evenly browned. Set aside the sausage, and wipe the skillet. Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil, and toss in the scallops. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cook and stir about 3 minutes, until opaque and lightly browned. Set aside. Wipe the skillet, and heat another 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat. Cook and stir the green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper until tender. Remove from heat, and set aside. Heat the remaining olive oil in the skillet over medium high heat, and cook and stir the garlic until tender. Pour in the wine, and bring to a boil. Cook until most of the wine has been reduced, and scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Mix in the clam juice, bring to a boil, and cook until reduced by about 1/2. Return the chorizo, scallops, and peppers to the skillet, and toss until coated. Serve over the cooked linguine. This personal creation gives a magnificent presentation. The bright colors of the red, yellow, and green bell peppers along with the white wine and clam broth deliver flavor and texture everyone will enjoy.
Place rhubarb in a large bowl. Pour sugar over top and stir to coat. Cover bowl and refrigerate overnight. Place rhubarb mixture in a pot and cook over medium heat until tender, stirring frequently. Stir in pie filling and gelatin, and bring mixture to a boil. Pour into a shallow pan and allow to cool in refrigerator. When jelly is cool, pack into jars or plastic containers. Can be refrigerated or frozen. An unusual and delicious treat made with cherry gelatin and cherry pie filling in addition to fresh rhubarb. My family always liked this.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a large loaf pan. Combine flour, 1 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl. Add melted butter; stir until mixture is crumbly. Reserve about 1/4 cup cranberries and 1/4 cup mandarin oranges; stir remaining fruit into flour mixture. Beat eggs, milk, sour cream, vanilla extract, and orange extract in another bowl until smooth. Gradually stir egg mixture into flour mixture until batter is thoroughly incorporated. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan. Scatter reserved cranberries and mandarin oranges atop batter and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes; reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until center of bread springs back when touched, 35 to 40 minutes. Super-moist dessert bread loaded with mandarin oranges and whole cranberries. Makes great gifts.
Scoop sapodilla pulp out of the fruit and place it in a blender; add ice, chocolate-flavored almond milk, strawberries, and vanilla-flavored almond milk. Blend together until smooth. Sapodilla tastes kind of like caramel flan to me. The strawberries and chocolate almond milk turn this smoothie into a delicious drink with various textures.
In a saucepan, combine sugar and cocoa. Stir in water to make a paste. Add milk and butter. Cook over medium heat until it comes to a boil. Continue boiling for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and beat until cool enough to spread on cake. This is one of my favorite chocolate frosting recipes.
Build a campfire and allow the fire to burn until it has accumulated a bed of coals. Rake the coals into a flat bed on one side of the fire. Tear off a large sheet of foil or parchment paper, and line the Dutch oven, folding the paper or foil as needed to make it fit (or use a purchased Dutch oven liner). In a bowl, lightly toss the bread crumbs, dry milk powder, sugar substitute, pecans, chocolate chips, and salt until thoroughly combined. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with vanilla extract and oil, and whisk in the water. Pour the liquid ingredients into the crumb mixture, and stir to moisten. Pour the pudding mixture into the prepared Dutch oven, and cover the oven. Place the oven into the hot coals, and place more glowing coals onto the lid of the oven. Cook covered for 1 hour, and don't peek until the hour is up. Check for firmness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the pudding. If it comes out clean, the pudding is done. If not, recover the oven, and cook for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. This is a modification of an old-time favorite recipe by my mother, Aldine Bonner, from the late 1930's, to take with you camping.  A 6-quart Dutch oven is perfect for convenient baking in the coals or with charcoal briquettes. Serves 8 to 10 persons. Good with a fresh pot of coffee or whipped cream if you have it.
Blend water, cocoa powder, apricots, walnuts, and stevia together in a blender until smooth. Stir blended cocoa mixture and chia seeds together in a bowl. Let pudding sit until thickened, about 30 minutes. Transfer pudding to a serving bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until serving. This delicious, nutritious pudding is easy to make and easier to eat! Yum! Chia seeds have a crunchy/slippery texture which makes them fun to chew. Great for the kids as a healthy snack and dessert.
In a medium bowl, dredge candied fruit and raisins in 1 cup flour. In a large bowl, cream together brown sugar and butter.  Beat in eggs.  Gradually beat in bourbon and milk. Mix in remaining flour and spices. Stir in fruit and nuts. Refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Drop dough by teaspoonfuls, about 2 inches apart, onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for approximately 15 minutes.  Remove from oven, and cool on wire racks. I make these cookies in place of Fruitcakes. They go much faster.  These cookies will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator, or store in a closed tin after baking. They are better after several days. Best if made a week or two before Christmas, and hope some are left for Christmas
Heat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease bottoms only of 12 muffin cups or line with baking cups. In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, blueberries, grated lemon zest and salt; mix well. In a small bowl, combine milk, oil and egg; blend well. Add dry ingredients all at once; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened (batter will be lumpy.) Fill cups 2/3 full.  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 1 minute before removing from pan. Serve warm. Great muffins made with fresh or frozen blueberries.
In a glass baking pan, stir together the Worcestershire sauce, garlic, 2 tablespoons red pepper flakes, vinegar, oregano, basil, black pepper and olive oil. Place the meat into the sauce; cover and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Remove meat from the marinade, and discard marinade. Thread the marinated beef, chili peppers, and red bell pepper onto skewers. Grill the skewers about 4 to 6 minutes on each side, or until the meat is of the desired doneness. Place a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Remove meat and peppers from skewers, and place them in the pan. Season with chili powder, and stir in tomatoes and pinto beans. Sprinkle in the remaining red pepper flakes. Have you ever had grilled chili? Think it sounds wicked? Well, you're right! This chili will keep your mouth on fire and howling at the moon...

Heat olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until onion is softened and browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Add green bell pepper and cook until softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomato, chicken stock, black beans, and corn; cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, about 10 minutes. Stir chorizo into mixture. Flip squash over and fill each half with chorizo mixture; top with Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Spicy chorizo is a perfect offset to the mellow meat of summer squash. Leftover bean and chorizo mixture is great for breakfast burritos.
Cook the macaroni according to package directions.  Drain. In a saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter or margarine over medium heat.  Add onion and garlic, and saute until onions have a rich golden color.  Mix in the tomatoes and the spices.   Stir in milk and 3/4 cup shredded cheese.  Let sauce simmer gently until the cheese is melted, stirring often.  Mix in the cooked macaroni. Transfer macaroni and cheese to an ovenproof pan.  Sprinkle with breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup cheese.  Dice remaining 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, and spread evenly over the top. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 45 minutes. Easy and very good.  Soothing on a cold day together with a salad.
Place white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe 2-cup measuring cup; heat in microwave until melted, about 2 minutes. Stir until smooth. Place lemon drop candies in a resealable plastic bag. Place this bag into another resealable bag, creating a double bag so the candies don't puncture the bag. Crack candies with rolling pin or mallet until broken into small pieces. Stir cracked candies into melted white chocolate. Smooth mixture onto a piece of aluminum foil to about 1/4-inch thickness. Chill in refrigerator until set, at least 30 minutes. Break bark into small pieces and store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. This is an easy, yummy, very addictive candy.   Since there are only two ingredients, it is essential to use only high quality ingredients.
Pour sugar and pomegranate juice into a sauce pan and warm over low heat, whisking continuously until the sugar dissolves. Cool, pour into a bottle or jar, and store sealed in the refrigerator. It's extremely easy to make homemade grenadine. It's a two-ingredient operation. Your cocktails will thank you.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Wrap each mushroom with a strip of bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Arrange the mushrooms on a medium baking sheet. Bake approximately 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until the bacon is evenly brown. Serve hot. Mushrooms are an excellent vehicle for beloved bacon in these easy to make appetizers. Use toothpicks to hold the bacon in place while baking. I usually have to make a double batch of this party favorite to satisfy our guests.

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean. Cool a couple of minutes, then turn layers out onto cooling rack. Cool completely before icing. For the icing: Beat butter, cream cheese, and vanilla until smooth. Add confectioners sugar and continue beating until smooth. Ice a layer, add the second layer, and finish icing the cake. Refrigerate until time to serve.  Just before serving, pour the cherry pie filling on top and spread it gently to the edges. A few of the cherries will roll down the sides. That's what you want. A double-layer cake made with cherry pie filling, topped with cream cheese frosting and cherry pie filling. Very moist and dense and cherry-licious. You can also put it in a 9 x 13 inch pan if you don't want to store the two layer cake

Pour the egg substitute into a separate bowl, and dip the fillets in the egg.  Press fillets in the coconut mixture coating all sides. Heat canola oil in a frying pan to a temperature of about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Fry fillets one or two at a time on both sides until golden brown.  Remove to drain on a paper towel.  Prepare the apricot dipping sauce by stirring together the jam, mustard, and horseradish in a small bowl.  Serve the tilapia accompanied by the dipping sauce. After having coconut shrimp at a famous restaurant here in Phoenix, I decided to recreate it at home using a mild white fish filet and tilapia was my first choice.  Sit back and enjoy the compliments.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Combine the brown sugar with 1/4 cup butter, cinnamon, and five spice powder in a microwave safe bowl. Cook in the microwave on High until the butter has completely melted. Place the acorn squash cut side up onto the aluminum foil; brush with the brown sugar mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the squash is tender and golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven, allow to cool, and scoop out and reserve the flesh.

Add the acorn squash, garlic, and seafood stock. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 30 minutes. Stir the cream and basil into the simmering soup; season with nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Once pureed, add the crawfish tails, and simmer a few minutes until hot. Fall acorn squash roasted with warm spices, butter, and brown sugar. Finished with fresh basil and Louisiana Crawfish tails.
Place the carrots in a saucepan with about 1 inch of water in the bottom. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish. Place the carrots in the dish. In a medium bowl, stir together the onion, mayonnaise, horseradish, pepper, paprika and bread crumbs. Spread evenly over the carrots. Bake uncovered for 15 minutes, or until the top is nicely browned. This is an easy-to-make family favorite and has always been served as a side dish at our Thanksgiving dinners. Don't let the horseradish scare you. It merely adds a tangy flavor. You can use pre-made bread crumbs to make it even easier. Light mayo works fine and so does cooking spray on the casserole dish in place of butter.

Remove baking dish from refrigerator, and pour warm mixture into the cooled baking dish. Refrigerate until firm,  1 to 2 hours. When firm, remove from refrigerator, lift one side with a spatula, and turn out onto a cutting board or parchment paper sprinkled with granulated sugar. Using a sharp knife, cut gelatin into squares or use a small cookie cutter for decorative shapes. Coat the jellies on all sides with sugar. Place on a rack, and allow to dry overnight. Store in an airtight container. Fruit jellies are a simple and sweet treat, but when you give them a pina colada flavor, you just might find them addicting.
Combine strawberries, honey, and mint leaves in a small saucepan; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until honey dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour mixture into blender.

Tender steaks of beef tenderloin get the royal treatment with herbs and a horseradish and Dijon mustard coating. Prep this entree for marinating a day ahead and then just bake it in the oven.
Whisk together the soy sauce and sugar in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved, and stir in the black pepper, garlic, green onions, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. Place the ribs in a large bowl, and pour the marinade over the ribs. Stir to coat the ribs with the marinade, and refrigerate for 1 hour. Stir the ribs and marinade again, and refrigerate for 1 more hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the ribs from the marinade, discard the marinade, and grill the ribs until brown and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Have a spray bottle of water handy in case the ribs flare up. This is a family recipe that's not only simple, but tastes great!  Only needs some steamed rice to complete the meal.

Mix in the pork slices, mixing well until completely coated. Place into a resealable plastic bag, squeeze out any excess air, seal, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 3 hours. Heat the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork slices in batches, and cook until no longer pink in the center, and lightly browned on the outside, about 5 minutes per batch. Be careful when cooking the meat, the spicy fumes will hurt your nose! This spicy Korean pork is very good served with rice, kimchi, and salad.
Puree vinegars, onions, parsley, anchovies, garlic, salt, and lemon juice in a blender until well combined.  Blend in mayonnaise and serve. This is my first time using this site. I saw your request and remembered my Grandma's church cook book from 1960. Hope you'll enjoy it.
Place celery, garlic, tomato paste, bouillon cubes, and water into a large Dutch oven; stir until the tomato paste has dissolved. Add peppercorns and bay leaves, place over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

Pour out all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the skillet, reduce heat to medium, and cook the onion until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes; add to oxtail. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 2 1/2 hours. Season with salt and pepper, recover, and continue to cook until the oxtail is tender, but not falling off of the bone, about 30 minutes. Remove oxtail pieces and place into a serving dish. Add kidney beans to Dutch oven and return to a simmer. Thicken with cornstarch dissolved in water, simmer for 1 minute until thickened and clear. Pour sauce over the oxtail. Oxtail is my favorite meal and I serve this recipe to all my friends and use it for my frozen food business. Everyone loves it. I call it God's food as it is so delicious! This meal is very rich, but oh so good! Oxtail is easily available here in Africa but I have heard it can be obtained in the US.

Dip the shrimp into the mixture allowing them to be completely coated. Then roll the shrimp in the breadcrumbs. Coat the shrimp well with the breadcrumbs. Mix up the cornstarch batter again. Dip the breadcrumbs coated shrimp back into the cornstarch batter. Roll the shrimp in the breadcrumbs for a second time.  Repeat for each shrimp. Drop shrimp, one at a time, into the hot oil and cook shrimp until they are golden brown. These shrimp will knock your socks off!  The batter doesn't overcoat the shrimp, which helps it maintain a wonderful flavor! Enjoy!
Beat together the butter or margarine, eggs, brown sugar and vanilla. Add oats, flours, baking soda, salt and chocolate chips. Bake at 325 degrees F (170 degrees C) for 10 - 12 minutes. Received this recipe at a cookie exchange many years ago.  An all time favorite, now.
Place onion, carrots, green bell pepper, cucumber, radishes, broccoli, cherry tomatoes, garlic, vinaigrette, pepperoncini juice, salt, and pepper in a food processor; pulse until evenly chopped. Refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 hour. This relish is a super healthy way to get your veggies! You can easily make it a dip or play around with the chop size for an alternative to conventional salsa. I love it on fish tacos or a side dish with a light menu. Add herbs like parsley or cilantro for a different taste to suit your meal.
Preheat grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Break up ground beef with the tip of a fork in a bowl. Drizzle in the soy sauce, sake, mirin, Worcestershire sauce, and sriracha sauce; crumble in brown sugar. Use tines of a fork to evenly distribute ingredients. Finish mixing with your hands (ideally your hands should be very cold for this). Shape into 4 equal-sized patties. Grill until browned and cooked through turning once, 3 or 4 minutes per side. When burgers develop a slight dome shape and juices begin to come through the top surface, they are done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Serve burgers on slider buns with lettuce and tomato slices. Instead of using a sauce on the outside, I'm putting key teriyaki flavorings into the ground meat for these teriyaki burgers. Ideally these burgers should be cooked on a medium-hot charcoal grill, weather permitting.
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Spread onion slices in a single layer on the bottom of a baking dish. Season chicken with salt. Place chicken halves, skin-side down, over onion rings. Cook chicken in the preheated oven, turning every 7 minutes, until caramelized, no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). The next time rain ruins your dream of a grilled chicken dinner, I hope you fire up your broiler and give this easy, alternative method a try. Not only are you getting the same intense, direct heat, but you also have more control, since you can adjust how far the chicken is from the flame. I prefer the meat about 7 to 8 inches under the heating element, but feel free to adjust as needed. Garnish with freshly squeezed lemon juice and fresh oregano.
In a large skillet, warm oil over medium heat and saute bacon, onion and garlic until bacon is browned and crisp; set aside. In large saucepan, brown beef and pork. Drain off excess fat.

Press each half into the prepared pans.  Bake 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges.  Centers should be firm. Cool in the pan on wire rack.  Serve by cutting into wedges. Big as a platter and suitable for a birthday! Drizzle with icing and light the candles!
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl combine crushed pretzels,  3 tablespoons confectioner's (powdered) sugar and melted butter.  Mix well and press into a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes.  Cool. To make the filling, combine in a medium bowl the cream cheese and 1 cup confectioner's (powdered) sugar; beat until smooth.  Stir in whipped topping; spread mixture in crust and refrigerate. Meanwhile, combine gelatin mix and boiling water; add strawberries.  Let gelatin mixture thicken slightly, and then pour over the crust and filling layers.  Refrigerate for 4 hours. This is a really good dessert. The combo of sweet, crunchy, and slightly salty is super good.  It is very popular here in the Mississippi Valley. Plan ahead, it needs to refrigerate for 4 hours.
Mix edamame, corn, peas, black beans, and red onion in a large bowl. Stir olive oil, vinegar, salt, parsley, black pepper, basil, and garlic powder into edamame mixture. Chill in refrigerator at least 30 minutes before serving. Nice fresh salad for summer that's a little different from the norm. The seasonings can be adjusted to taste, these are just rough guesses since I usually just add till it tastes good.
Place the shredded potatoes in a cloth, and wring as much of the moisture out as possible. Place the potatoes into a bowl, and stir in the onion soup mix, garlic, eggs, flour, Cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper until well mixed. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it shimmers, and drop the potato mixture by heaping tablespoons into the hot oil. Press down on the patties to flatten them to about 1/3 inch thick. Fry the patties until golden brown and crisp on the bottoms, 5 to 8 minutes, then flip and cook the other side until crisp and golden. Remove the latkes to paper towels to drain, and serve hot, sprinkled with green onion and a small dollop of sour cream. These potato pancakes are both flavorful and crispy. It is so much easier if you have a food processor with a shredder on it. Either way, worth making!
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add Brussels sprouts and cook until slightly tender, about 2 minutes. Drain and immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes to stop the cooking process. Drain. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is just tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts; cook and stir until sprouts are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Mix balsamic vinegar, butter, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder into Brussels sprouts mixture; toss to coat. My mom gave me a taste of this recipe and after never having previously liked Brussels sprouts, I was hooked and begged her for the recipe!
Beat egg whites, almond milk, and vanilla extract together in a bowl until smooth; add coconut flour, baking powder, and sea salt and continue to beat until no clumps remain. Let the mixture sit for 8 minutes. Heat a small non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour about 1/3 of the batter into the pan. Tilt the pan so the batter covers the bottom of the skillet to all sides. Cook until the edges begin to slightly lift and the bottom is slightly browned, about 2 minutes; flip and cook until the other side is browned, 1 to 2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. I've practiced with coconut flour in many dishes. Don't let the unconventional type of flour fool you, it is very easy to work with! I've decided to share this, since not many others have submitted a Paleo-friendly crepe recipe. I strive to inspire, especially now that Valentine's Day is up here soon. Treat your lover with breakfast in bed with these amazing dessert-like crepes! Add Nutella®, bananas, or anything you want to your heart's content! These are super easy and healthier than the conventional crepe. Great for those that are looking for more fiber and in a Paleo diet.

Place strips flat in a shallow baking dish. Pour marinade over pork strips. Let pork marinate at least 6 hours in refrigerator. Drain, reserving marinade. Mix honey and 3 tablespoon reserved marinade in a small bowl; set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill a shallow roasting pan with water and place in bottom of oven. Carefully place pork strips on a roasting rack above roasting pan so all sides are exposed to heat. If you don't have a roasting rack, insert the curved end of an S-shaped hook, paper clip, or drapery hook in pork strips and hang them from the top shelf. Roast for 30 minutes. Baste pork strips with honey mixture. Roast 15 minutes and baste again. Roast 10 minutes longer or until pork strips are crisp and golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool. This tastes like the pork served in my favorite Chinese restaurant. Serve at room temperature arranged in overlapping layers on a platter. Garnish with cucumber slices, if desired.
Mix the mango, red bell pepper, shallot, jalapeno chile, and lime juice together in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper and set aside. Heat the olive oil and butter together in a skillet over high heat. Once the butter melts, add the scallops and cook until opaque and browned on the sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Combine the water, vegetable bouillon, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat; bring the mixture to a boil. Add the spinach to the mixture by the handful; cooking until each batch is wilted completely. Remove from heat, squeeze excess moisture from the spinach, and place equal portions into the center of 2 plates. Place half the scallops atop each pile of spinach. Spoon the mango salsa over the scallops. This is such a simple recipe, but it tastes and looks like something you would get at a restaurant!
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the cumin and ground red chilies, and cook for a few seconds until the spices are fragrant. Add the serrano chiles, onions, garbanzo beans, lemon juice, and water; season to taste with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vegetables are tender and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 15 minutes.

Add flour mixture and mix just until combined. Fold in reserved nuts. Spread batter evenly over apples and bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool 10 minutes, then invert onto serving plate. The cake in this recipe has a top layer of apple wedges, making it a hit for all ages. It's caramelly delicious in every way.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C ). Cream together butter and confectioners' sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Mix in flour, salt, and poppy seeds until well blended. Drop dough from a teaspoon onto an ungreased cookie sheet.  Make an indention in the middle of each cookie with your finger. If the dough is too sticky, dip your finger in water first.  Fill each hole with about 1/2 teaspoon of cherry preserves. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until edges begin to brown. A great poppy seed version of the thumbprint cookie. These are so good that they are almost addictive.

Dip the chicken cubes first into the eggs, then coat evenly with the bread crumbs. Heat about half of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the chicken, and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Remove the chicken and drain on a paper towel-covered plate. Add more oil to the skillet if needed. Stir in the mushrooms, onion, and wine. Cook and stir until the mushrooms are tender and have cooked down. This may take a good 15 minutes. Return the chicken to the skillet and stir into the mushroom mixture. Use scissors to cut the pepperoncini into slices over the skillet to retain the pepper juices. Discard any stems. Simmer the chicken mixture, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes more before serving. When I was a kid, my mom used to make this as my birthday dinner. Now, I make it every chance I get. It's a fantastic dish that is one of my family's favorites. If you like things spicy, add an extra pepperoncini or two. If not, use a little less. Try it, You'll love it!

Place pizza stone on grill directly over wood fire. You may need to begin by spreading out the wood if the flames are too tall. Roll out the pizza dough to desired thickness. Place it on the pizza stone and cook 10 minutes on one side until golden. Remove from the fire and on the cooked side, spread the pizza sauce in an even layer over dough leaving about a half inch around the rim of the pizza dough bare. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly on top of the sauce, followed by the pepperoni slices. Place uncooked side down, back on the pizza stone. Cover with a foil tent and cook until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes more. Transfer pizza to a cutting board and let cool slightly before cutting and serving. This is easy as pie... no pun intended. The smokey flavor from the wood fire puts a great twist on an old favorite and with the help of a pizza stone, doing this over an open fire is easier than you may think.
Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag; add chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and 1/2 of the beer. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; pour chicken and marinade into the hot oil. Cook and stir, adding the remaining beer, until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Shred chicken in the skillet using 2 forks and serve in corn tortillas. This is very basic. My husband isn't a fan of veggies in things, so if you add onions and peppers even better! It can get very spicy so this isn't a dish for bland food lovers - even the 'mild' ways to cook it have a bite.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Divide the sweet potato cubes in half, and place each half in the center of a rectangle of aluminum foil. Top each portion with about half of the butter. Sprinkle about half of the brown sugar, cumin, and cayenne pepper over each portion. Season with salt and pepper. Fold the corners of the aluminum foil together and seal to form a pouch around each portion. Cook on the preheated grill, turning pouches every 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes. I don't really like the traditional sweet potato casserole, but my son loves sweet potatoes, so I try to come up with different ways to cook them. This spring I tried grilling them. These are now a favorite of mine and my sons.

Blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth. Butternut squash, sweet potato, carrot, and garlic roasted in large pieces and then added to onion, celery, apple, and vegetable broth. Immersion blender does the trick for thickening without adding fat. Use curry powder in place of cayenne if you prefer more savory flavors than spicy. Apple juice can also be used in place of cider, and chicken broth in place of vegetable.
Spread potato chips on a flat surface. Spoon sour cream into a small resealable plastic bag. Press the sour cream into a corner and cut the corner of the bag off with scissors. Pipe about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon sour cream into the center of each chip. Top sour cream with about 1/2 gram trout caviar; garnish caviar with a few pieces of chopped chive. Of course this will work with any type of caviar. Having said that, when you consider value, it's hard to beat these golden beads. Trout roe has a fresh, clean, briny flavor, and an absolutely beautiful texture. The feeling of those little, subtly salty eggs popping on your tongue is one of life's great food experiences.

Seal the bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, turning occasionally. Preheat a grill for medium heat. Remove the chicken from the plastic bag, discarding the marinade. Place the chicken pieces on the preheated grill and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, or until firm and no longer pink in the center. If you have a meat thermometer, it should measure 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) when measured in the thickest part. Remove chicken to a cutting board and allow to rest for about 5 minutes. While the chicken is resting, combine the salad greens, cranberries, and orange segments. Pour the reserved citrus marinade over the salad and toss lightly to coat. Divide the salad between four serving plates. Slice each piece of chicken crosswise into 1/2 inch strips. Arrange over the tops of the salads and sprinkle with orange zest strips. This whimsical and delicious chicken salad was inspired by the famous Cosmopolitan cocktail.  The cranberry-citrus mixture is used in two ways - one portion to marinate the chicken and the remainder as a salad dressing.  The crisp and clean flavor combinations create a light and healthy yet totally satisfying salad that enhances the chicken.  An indoor grill pan may be used to cook the chicken, if preferred.

Cut pastry into four 6 inch circles; place circles on lined cookie sheet and lightly brush with egg beat. Place 1/4 cup of feta cheese onto each circle and top with some beef mixture, leaving enough room to seal dough 'pockets'. Remove second pie crust from pan and roll out on lightly floured surface. Cut pastry into four 6 inch circles, as with first pie crust. Brush one side of each circle with egg beat and place, egg-side-down, on top of prepared pie circles. Pinch crusts together to seal around the edges. Use dough scraps to fill any holes or tears in the pie  'pockets'. Brush tops with egg beat and make a small slit in the top of each pie (to allow steam to escape). Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 25 minutes, or until cooked through and golden brown. Pie pastry circles filled with feta cheese and a seasoned ground beef mixture for a wedding of savory sensations that is then baked to a golden finish.  I make this when company comes over, and they all rave about it. It's the feta cheese that gives it a gourmet flavor, and the crust comes out very flakey and buttery. Marinated beef cuts also work well.
Place the bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate. Stir in the onion, celery, bell pepper, and carrots. Cook and stir until the onions have softened and turned translucent, about 8 minutes. Add the cream-style corn, whole kernel corn, chicken broth, and potatoes. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in the diced bacon and season with salt and pepper to taste before serving. Growing up in Indiana we ate a lot of corn in the summer. This is my mom's recipe, and now I make it for my family. Always a hit! Rather than using fresh potatoes, you may substitute frozen hash browns.
Bring the rice and water to a boil together in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 35 to 40 minutes. When the rice is nearly done cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. Cook the onion in the hot oil until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken, garlic, and ginger to the skillet and continue cooking and stirring until the chicken is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Fold the mushrooms, asparagus, bell peppers, and fish sauce into the chicken mixture; continue cooking just until hot, about 5 minutes. Crack the egg, and scramble it into the mixture. Add the basil leaves to the mixture; cook until the leaves wilt slightly, about 30 seconds. Remove pan from heat immediately. Serve over the basmati rice; garnish with the cilantro and sesame seeds and a drizzle of the tamari soy sauce. Simple and delicious, this Asian-style chicken recipe is one I've refined over years. I used to spice it up as I love hot food, but this recipe just works better when you let the fresh flavors speak for themselves. You can also leave out the chicken and just make it with two eggs if you want a vegetarian option.
Preheat the oven's broiler. In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion soup mix, water, garlic, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, ketchup, mustard and pepper using your hands. Pat into 4 large thick patties. Place them on a broiler pan. Broil the burgers for about 15 minutes per side, or until well done. Place buns on the broiler pan and toast briefly. Place whole green onions on the broiler pan at the same time, and just toast until limp. Place burger patties onto the bottom halves of the buns and top each one with a slice of cheese and some avocado slices. Top with the top buns. Serve with green onions. These burgers are delicious and very big! A perfect blend of spices give these big burgers a spicy kick!
Cut the chickens into pieces, reserving the breasts. Place chicken pieces except the breasts in a deep saucepan over medium heat; add the onion, garlic, and chicken broth. Cover the pan and simmer 25 minutes. Cut the breasts into halves and add to the saucepan; simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove the chicken to a cutting board. Remove the skin and bones from the chicken; cut the meat into bite sized pieces. Strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer, reserving the liquid and discarding the onion, garlic, and skimmed fat. If you have less than 3 cups of reserved liquid, add water to make 3 cups. If you have more than 3 cups, return to the pan and bring to a boil; cook until volume of liquid reduces to 3 cups. Combine the chili powder, almonds, banana, cinnamon, salt, tortilla pieces, sesame seeds, and pine nuts in a blender. Blend on low, slowly adding the reserved liquid in a stream until the mixture is smooth. Pour the mixture and remaining liquid into a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter and chocolate; cook and stir until the butter and chocolate have melted. Stir the chicken pieces into the sauce; continue cooking until the chicken is heated completely through, 5 to 10 minutes. Chocolate is the surprising ingredient in this one. Serve it over rice or with a side of veggies.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, milk and cream. Stir this mixture into the saucepan along with the Parmesan cheese. Heat through, then reduce heat to low, and simmer until thick, about 2 minutes. Drain the tortellini, but do not rinse, then pour them into the saucepan with the sauce. Stir to coat, and serve. An old boyfriend's mother used to cook this for me whenever I ate over. Cheese tortellini are served in a creamy tomato and spinach sauce. I love it!

Lightly flour a pastry cloth. Sift 1 1/2 cups flour with salt onto a board and make a well in the center. Add beaten egg mixed with 1/3 cup warm milk, 2 teaspoon melted butter and vinegar into center of the well. Depending on your flour you may have to add more milk. Combine the ingredients quickly with your fingers, working from the outside of the well, and when it is mixed, knead the dough on a board until the dough is pliable and silky and no longer sticks to the board. Brush the surface of the ball with melted butter and cover the dough with a warm bowl and let it rest 30 minutes to 1 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Roll it out on the board as thin as possible. Move it to the table. Begin to stretch the dough gently from the center out, trying not to tear it. It should stretch to about 1 yard square. A heavier edge of dough or a border will develop as you work, and whatever remains of this must be cut off with a knife before the filling is spread or the pastry rolled up. Fill pastry with ingredients and roll or fold over. Brush the surface with melted butter and bake 20 minutes, then lower temperature to 350 and brush again with melted butter. Bake for about 10 minutes longer or until browned. This is used in place of phyllo dough as it is much easier to make.

Increase the heat to high, and stir in the Chinese cooking wine. Cook and stir until the cabbage is tender, about 2 minutes more. A very simple stir-fry dish. The reason for using only soya sauce for stir-frying cabbage is that it brings out the natural sweetness in the cabbage itself.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter a baking dish. Spread squash slices into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Stir brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, ginger, and salt together in a bowl; drizzle over the squash. Continue baking squash in oven until completely tender, 15 to 20 minutes more. Delicata squash is one of the best winter squashes even though it is a fairly 'new' squash. The skin can be eaten and it is almost the best part of the squash.

Whisk together the cream of mushroom soup, Chardonnay, Cheddar cheese, onion flakes, garlic powder, and black pepper in a large bowl; set aside. Combine the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Dip the chicken breasts into the beaten egg, then press into bread crumb mixture. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded chicken onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan fry the chicken breasts until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Place the browned chicken in the prepared baking dish; then cover with the mushroom soup mixture. Bake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). We often spend weekends at our family vacation home on Lake Chelan.  Tired of the weekend's restaurant fare, I created this recipe using ingredients I had on hand in the kitchen, including a wonderful Chardonnay from the nearby Big Pine Winery.  This is a family-pleasing and comforting recipe of breaded and lightly fried chicken breasts baked in a creamy mushroom wine sauce.
In a large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thick. Stir in the melted butter and vanilla. Sift together the flour and baking powder, and blend into the batter until smooth. Heat the pizzelle iron, and brush with oil. Drop about one tablespoon of batter onto each circle on the iron. You may need to experiment with the amount of batter and baking time depending on the iron. Bake for 20 to 45 seconds, or until steam is no longer coming out of the iron. Carefully remove cookies from the iron. Cool completely before storing in an airtight container. For chocolate pizzelles, add 1/4 cup cocoa sifted together with flour and baking powder, 1/4 cup more sugar and 1/4 teaspoon more baking powder. I find that for the chocolate mixture, the iron must be well oiled to start and then brush on more as needed. This recipe calls for a batter-like dough and is baked on a pizzelle iron. Powdered sugar adds an elegant touch. In the Italian version, vanilla is replaced by anise. Chocolate may also be used.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together butter, poppy seeds, onion, Worcestershire sauce and prepared Dijon-style mustard.

Drop dough by 1/2 teaspoonfuls 1 1/2 inches apart onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 4 to 6 minutes, until light brown. Let cookies cool for about 2 minutes before removing from baking sheets to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cooled cookies in an airtight container. Since I live in the South people refer to these cookies as Benne Wafers, they are actually Sesame Seed Cookies. Toasting benne (sesame) seeds develops their flavor and also gives these cookies a slightly crunchy texture.

Add the caraway and mustard seeds, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the mustard seeds stop popping.  Drizzle the hot oil mixture immediately over the cabbage mixture and toss the coleslaw well.  Add salt to taste and toss again. This is a nice change for coleslaw and the tangy vinaigrette is one you will want to make over and over!  A nice accompaniment to a plain meat dish.
Place water, peanut butter, jelly, brown sugar, salt, baking soda, baking powder, gluten, 3 1/3 cups plus 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour, and yeast, respectively, in the pan of a bread machine. Select 1 1/2 Pound Loaf, Medium Crust, Wheat cycle, and press Start. I wanted a 100% whole wheat bread that tasted good with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and that has a decent rise. This one not only tastes good, it rises more than than white-bread-flour recipe I used to make. It is also soft and freezes well. I make my bread on Sunday, then make and freeze my sandwiches for the week. Each day I take one out of the freezer and Friday's is just as good as the one on Monday. You can use any flavor jelly.

Place the beets in a small baking dish or roasting pan, and toss with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. If you wish to peel the beets, it is easier to do so once they have been roasted. Cover, and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a knife can slide easily through the largest beet. When the roasted beets are almost done, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat. Add the garlic and onion, and cook for a minute. Tear the beet greens into 2 to 3 inch pieces, and add them to the skillet. Cook and stir until greens are wilted and tender. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the greens as is, and the roasted beets sliced with either red-wine vinegar, or butter and salt and pepper. This is a great way to use every part of the fresh beets you buy.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Combine the water, cinnamon sticks, and sugar in a large saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.  Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the cinnamon turns the water dark brown, about 15 minutes.  Remove cinnamon sticks and reserve the water. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Fry the slices of French bread in oil until light brown, turning if necessary, about 1 minute per side.  Remove toasted bread from the oil and place on paper towels to drain. Arrange half of the toasted bread in a single layer in the greased casserole dish. Sprinkle bread with half of the raisins, pecans, and onion. Arrange a layer of Cheddar cheese on top. Repeat with another layer of bread, raisins, pecans, onions, and cheese. Slowly pour the reserved cinnamon water over the casserole, allowing the bread to absorb as much of the liquid as possible.  Do not allow the dish to overflow. Cover dish with aluminum foil and place in the center of the preheated oven.  Bake until lightly browned and puffed, about 30 minutes.   Remove from oven and allow to rest for 15 minutes before serving. Several varieties of this dessert exist, depending upon which region of Mexico or Texas it's made in.  The biggest difference being the nut used. My own preference is to use pecans.
Beat together the cream cheese and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until creamy.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. A grown up version of an old favorite: moist banana muffins with chocolate chips, shredded coconut and Jack Daniels® for a little extra kick. I love playing with recipes and wanted something more than the standard banana muffin.

My mom sometimes takes shortcuts and uses pre-made meatballs from a bag, which, after spending a few hours in the slow cooker, taste fine. I like these best when they are made completely from scratch! Ground turkey works too, but doesn't hold its shape as well. To turn into a meal, heat rice to serve with the dish. The serving size refers to this dish as a main meal, but when served as an hors d'oeuvre, easily can feed 10 to 13 people. Sometimes I do not add the cornstarch into the sauce, and just allow it to boil for a bit longer, but the cornstarch really does yield the best result.

Remove the turkey from the grill, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 1 hour before carving to serve. This is the best Thanksgiving turkey you could possibly imagine. The first time my husband cooked it he was concerned about it getting done, left it on the grill a little longer than suggested, and it literally fell off the bone when we moved it to the serving plate, but I hardly had any leftovers to put away! We have also stuffed the turkey with sweet onion while smoking and it turned out wonderfully.

This helps to thicken the soup. I also like to use seasoned chicken broth. You can use heavy cream or half-and-half, depending on how rich you want the soup to be.
The bean hole should be 2 1/2 to 3 feet deep, depending on your pot. The hole should be big enough around to have a 6 inch space between the pot and the edge of the hole on all sides. To help hold heat, put some old tire chains or stones in the hole before starting the fire. Start the fire and keep it filled with good dry hardwood. Let it burn for about 3 hours.  The hole should be at least 3/4 full of hot coals. After the fire has been going for about an hour, place the beans in a large pot, on the stove with water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until skins roll back when you blow on them, about 45 minutes. Watch closely, because they will get mushy if left too long. When the hole is ready, cut the salt pork in to 2 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick slices. Place them into the bottom of the bean pot. Peel and cut the onions in half; lay them on top of the pork. Pour the beans and their liquid into the pot, then mix in the molasses, black pepper and dry mustard. Slice butter and place on top. Add enough boiling water to cover the beans by one inch. Cover the top of the pot tightly with aluminum foil so that it goes down over the sides by at least 2 inches. Place lid onto bean pot. Before putting the pot into the hole, remove about 1/3 of the coals using a shovel. Remove and discard any burning pieces of wood. Place the bean pot into the hole, and put the coals from the hole back in around the sides and over the top of the bean pot. Now start filling the hole in with the dirt, packing it down with your feet as you go. You should end up with about 2 feet of dirt covering the pot. Cover the place where the beans are buried with a tarp or piece of metal to keep out rain. Let the beans stew overnight in their bean hole. Carefully dig them out the next day and enjoy!

Stir okra into onion mixture. Garnish with cilantro. Okra, sweet and delish. Stir-fry turns okra golden brown and tender. I served as a side dish with grilled lamb or pork chops. Add rice and you have a complete quick meal.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together the soup, sour cream, salad dressing, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Gently stir in the French-cut green beans and the other green beans one can at a time. Fold in 1 cup of the fried onions. Pour the mixture into a casserole dish; cover with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven 35 minutes. Remove the foil and stir the casserole. Top with the remaining cup of the fried onions and bake uncovered for an additional 5 minutes. This green bean casserole is a classic in my family. I made it up when I was out of milk one time and have been making it ever since.
In a saucepan combine the sugar, milk, cocoa, and margarine. Cook over medium high heat, stirring constantly, bring mixture to a boil and boil for 1 minute. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla, peanut butter, and quick cooking oats. Drop spoonfuls of batter onto sheets of greased waxed paper. Let cool. Store cookies in an airtight container. These cookies can either be dropped by the spoonful or spread in a buttered pan and cut into squares.
In a medium bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the eggs, vanilla extract and butter. Using the fingers, mix well, until a firm dough has formed. Wrap in a clean tea towel and chill in the refrigerator 8 to 12 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Turn a 9 inch round baking dish upside down, and lightly grease the surface. Pinch off a portion of the dough and roll out into a 9 inch circle approximately 1/3 inch thick. Continue this process with all the dough, making 5 to 7 layers. Bake each layer individually in the preheated oven 8 minutes, or until lightly brown. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, place the dried fruit in enough water to cover. Cook until soft and spreadable, but not runny, about 20 minutes. Drain the fruit well. Mix in the cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Stack the layers, spreading equal portions of the fruit mixture between each layer and on top of the final layer. Chill in the refrigerator 8 to 12 hours, or overnight. This is a tall, lopsided old-fashioned family favorite. Dried fruit is soaked and spiced to make the filling. The cake layers are baked on top of the round cake pans, not inside.  Make sure the dough is well chilled. Any type of dried fruit may be used. We love apple!
Drizzle the bottom of a 4-quart slow cooker crock with olive oil. Stir tomatoes with juice, seitan, sausage, onion, green bell pepper, celery, vegetable broth, garlic, miso paste, Cajun seasoning, thyme, and oregano into crock. Cook on Low for 4 hours. Add rice to the crock and cook on High until rice is cooked through, about 30 minutes more. Garnish with parsley. A good meal to freeze and throw in the slow cooker on a busy day. I prefer the rice cooked separately. You can substitute Creole seasoning for the Cajun seasoning and bok choy for the celery, if desired.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart baking dish. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the sweet potato, and cook until soft, about 10 minutes. Drain the sweet potatoes, and mash or whip until smooth. Mix the ground turkey together with the egg, sweet onion, garlic, barbecue sauce, ketchup,  Dijon mustard, and whole wheat bread crumbs in a large mixing bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the sweet potatoes, and stir until evenly combined. If the mixture seems too wet, add more bread crumbs. Use your hands to form the turkey mixture into a loaf shape and place in the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 1 hour. Slice the loaf to serve. I initially created this recipe after one my grandmother used to make with beef and regular mashed potatoes. Instead, I substituted mashed sweet potatoes and used ground turkey. It tastes even better the next day when slices are grilled in a pan with butter, then place on bread slices to make a sandwich. The biggest secret to the taste is the sweetness from the sweet potato!
Mix rice vinegar, sugar, jalapeno pepper, and cilantro in a bowl; stir until sugar has dissolved. Place jicama and 1/3 of the vinegar dressing in a resealable plastic bag; seal and refrigerate for 1 hour. Place shrimp in a separate resealable plastic bag with 1/3 of the dressing; seal and refrigerate for 1 hour. Refrigerate remaining vinegar dressing. Arrange alternate slices of tomatillo and tomato around the edge of a salad plate. Mound marinated jicama in the center of the plate and top with marinated shrimp. Pour remaining 1/3 of the dressing over salad. This salad is very easy to make and very refreshing on a hot summer day.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round baking dish. In a large bowl, cut together the self-rising flour, sugar, and butter with a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the raisins. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg with 1 cup of milk. Lightly mix the milk mixture into the flour mixture until it holds together. Place dough in prepared baking dish, and brush top with 1 tablespoon of milk for a nice golden brown crust. Place the bread into the preheated oven. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake for 1 hour. Let cool before serving. This is my mother's recipe.  She makes it several times a week for some function or another.  My sister loves this so much she has to control herself or she would eat a whole one with a stick of butter!  I usually only make this easy soda bread for events that my mother can't come to! Slice into wedges, butter, and enjoy!
In a large bowl, mix together the bread crumbs, eggs, butter, milk, salt, and allspice into a smooth dough.  Roll into golf ball-sized pieces. Cook by dropping into a boiling soup or broth. Simmer until they float to the top. Similar to matzo balls or dumplings, used in soups.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Season with basil, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Stir in fresh tomatoes and canned tomatoes; simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Add red wine and lemon juice; simmer for 5 minutes more. Stir shrimp and mushrooms into tomato mixture; cook and stir until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Serve sauce over linguine and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. A lovely blend of shrimp, mushrooms, and a light tomato basil sauce.
Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat and cook and stir onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into the onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir tomato sauce into the onion and spice mixture, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, paprika, and 1 tablespoon sugar. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into the hot oil, sprinkle with curry powder, and sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often. Transfer chicken and any pan juices into the sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust salt and sugar to taste. A classic curry-stand recipe. This is not haute cuisine; this is the kind of nuclear-orange tikka masala that you crave when you stumble out of a pub at 2 a.m. I make vast quantities of the sauce at one time, and it freezes very well. I also added much more cayenne pepper than 1 teaspoon, but I give out the recipe like this for people who don't like heat.
Place the rice and 2/3 cup water in a pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 40 minutes, until tender. Mix the textured vegetable protein and 3/4 cup boiling water in a medium bowl. Soak 15 minutes, until rehydrated. Mix in the cooked rice. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a bowl, mix the tomato soup and 10 3/4 fluid ounces (1 soup can) water. Place the cabbage in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 15 minutes, until leaves are easily removed. Drain, cool, and separate leaves. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion, carrot, red bell pepper, and garlic. Cook until tender. Mix in wine, and continue cooking until almost all liquid has evaporated. Stir in rice and textured vegetable protein, reserved juice from the tomatoes, egg, and peas. Season with cayenne pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, basil, and hot pepper sauce. Cook and stir until heated through. On 1 cabbage leaf, place about 2 tablespoons skillet mixture and 1 tomato. Roll tightly, and seal with a toothpick. Repeat with remaining filling. Arrange in a casserole dish. Pour the soup and water over cabbage rolls. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and bake 35 minutes in the preheated oven, basting occasionally with the tomato sauce. Remove cover, and continue baking 10 minutes. This is a wonderful recipe -- a little time consuming, but worth the work -- it tastes just like the meat version.
Mix creamy salad dressing, mustard, sugar, and vinegar together with a whisk in a large bowl; add egg slices and gently stir to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 30 minutes. A friend brought this to a party and everyone loved it. She shared the recipe with me, and I was unable to find one just like it online, so thought I would share it. Garnish with favorite deviled egg toppings (such as paprika), as desired.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread hazelnuts onto a baking sheet and roast in preheated oven until slightly browned and the skins are slightly blistered, 10 to 15 minutes. Spread a kitchen towel onto a flat work surface. Put the hazelnuts in the middle of the towel and wrap the towel around the nuts. Roll towel vigorously to strip the nuts from as much of the skins as you can remove. Discard skins and set nuts aside to cool completely. Put hazelnuts in a food processor and grind into a paste; add sugar, canola oil, cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt. Continue to process the mixture until it is as smooth as you can get it. Melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Pour chocolate into the food processor and blend into the hazelnut mixture. Use a spatula to transfer into a container with a tight-fitting lid, but cool completely at room temperature before sealing tightly. We were able to purchase fresh hazelnuts while in Portland last fall. This is one of the many ways to enjoy them.  Hoping for a 'healthier' version of the store-bought variety, dark chocolate is used here with great results (for dark chocolate lovers) or it may be made with milk chocolate for the more traditional flavor.
Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat.  Let cool until lukewarm. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl, combine yeast mixture, milk, sugar, oil, baking powder, salt, egg and 3 cups flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Heat brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter until melted. Remove from heat; stir in corn syrup. Divide mixture between two 9x13 inch baking pans. Sprinkle 1/2 cup pecans in each pan. When dough has doubled in size, punch down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out into a large rectangle and spread with butter. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Starting with the long side, roll up the rectangle into a log, and slice into 1 inch wide rolls. Place the rolls slightly apart in pans. Wrap pans with aluminum foil and refrigerate at least 12 hours but no longer than 48. Remove rolls from refrigerator and let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake uncovered in preheated oven until golden 30 to 35 minutes. Immediately invert pan on heatproof serving plate. Wait for 1 or 2 minutes before removing pan, so that caramel drizzles over rolls. These are easy and very good! They can be made and then cooked in the morning and make great hot rolls for special mornings (like Christmas or Easter). I have had a lot of compliments on these. Everyone will think that you got up very early to make these rolls because they are hot in the morning! I use my bread machine for the dough part, makes it very easy!
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add orzo and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and rinse with cold water.  Transfer to a large bowl and stir in spinach, feta, onion, pine nuts, basil and white pepper.  Toss with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Refrigerate and serve cold. A light, easy-to-make salad that's pleasing to the palate.
In a bowl, mix the ground pork with the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, cornstarch, black pepper, and red pepper flakes. Marinate at least 10 minutes. Place the tofu in a microwave-safe dish. Place the pork over the tofu. Discard any remaining marinade. Top with green onion, carrots, and chile pepper. Cover with microwave-safe plastic wrap. Cut a small slit in the plastic wrap to vent steam. Cook 5 minutes on High in the microwave, or until vegetables are tender and pork is cooked to desired doneness. Easy microwaved tofu that is quick to make but brings delight to both the taste buds and the eyes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 1 1/2 quart baking dish. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat.  Stir in celery soup, milk, salt and pepper.  Heat, stirring, until smooth.  Slowly stir in cheese and lemon juice, mixing well. Remove from heat and stir in eggs and garlic.  Mix well and pour into prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes. If you love garlic this is the recipe for you!!  This is great for a brunch or unusual side dish.
Pour the olive oil into a large, deep pot set over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; cook until transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the celery, carrots, vegetable broth, and water; cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat to medium, pour in the tomatoes, and cook 10 to 15 minutes more. Reduce heat to low, and mix in the lentils and chestnuts; cook for 1 hour until the chestnuts soften. Pour in more water to thin the stew, if desired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. This is a nice winter stew or soup that everyone loves in my family. It is so comforting on a cold winter night, or it can be a Thanksgiving dish substitute for vegetarians. It tastes wonderful the next day! Experiment with the vegetable combinations!
Whisk rice wine and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Lightly dust smelt with about 1 tablespoon flour. Add smelt to rice wine mixture; cover bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large wok to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix ice water, 1/2 cup flour, cornstarch, egg yolks, sesame seeds, sesame oil, baking powder, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Remove smelt from rice wine mixture and dip, 1 at a time, into the flour mixture until evenly coated. Discard remaining rice wine mixture. Carefully fry smelt, 2 or 3 at a time, in the hot oil until golden on all sides, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towel-lined plates. Repeat frying with remaining smelt. Serve warm. The classic Acadian way to cook smelt is to fry them. I put a twist on that tradition by frying them in this light tempura batter my husband and I use for shrimp. I serve this with heads on because, like anchovies, these fish are so small everything is edible. But you can remove heads and internal organs if desired.
Lightly combine the avocados with red wine vinegar in a salad bowl. Stir in the black beans, corn, tomatoes, green onions, and red onion. Whisk together the olive oil and Italian dressing mix in a bowl, pour over the salad, and toss lightly. A very mild salsa that everyone enjoys. I have a friend who hates every single ingredient in here except the corn, but he still loves the salsa. The longer it sits, the more the flavors come out. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir blue cheese salad dressing and cream cheese together in a mixing bowl. Stir chicken, Buffalo wings sauce, and blue cheese crumbles into the salad dressing mixture; pour sauce into a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes. Buffalo wings in a dip can be served with tortilla chips. Add celery if you like.
Place black beans in a medium size mixing bowl, partially mash beans -- beans should remain a little chunky. In a medium size frying pan, heat oil over a medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic and saute for 4 minutes. Mix beans, corn, tomato, picante sauce, cumin, and chili powder into the frying pan; cook for 5 minutes or until thickened. Remove the pan from the heat, mix in cheese, cilantro and lime juice; stir until cheese is melted. This black bean dip is great served with corn or flour tortilla chips.
Fill each celery stick with raspberry flavored cream cheese and top with 3 or 4 dried cranberries. I came up with this variation on Ants on a Log for Thanksgiving because my brother hates raisins. They would also work well for schools or daycares with nut-free rules for snacks and lunches.
Cook and stir bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a bowl with a slotted spoon, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the pan. Return skillet to medium heat; cook and stir onion, celery, and a pinch of salt until onion begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Add green bell pepper, red bell pepper, and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until bell peppers are soft, about 5 minutes. Pour vegetable oil into the onion mixture, sprinkle in flour, and cook until flour is browned and mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon black pepper, paprika, oregano, and cayenne pepper and stir to combine. Pour 1/4 cup of chicken broth into vegetable mixture; cook and stir, scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pan, until combined. Add remaining broth and Worcestershire sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and simmer until sauce is thick and reduced slightly, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Add andouille sausage, chicken, and reserved bacon. Cook until heated hot. Remove from heat, stir in green onions, and season with salt and black pepper to taste. This is an old, personal favorite recipe of mine. While not totally authentic, it celebrates the fabulous flavors of Cajun cuisine.  Serve this thick sauce over rice.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, gently stir together the gooseberries and sugar. Let stand for 15 minutes. Press one of the pie crusts into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch pie plate. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour and salt. Mix in the sour cream, eggs and vanilla. Add the gooseberry and sugar mixture, and stir to coat evenly. Spoon into the pie crust, and place the second crust over the top. Crimp the edges to seal, and cut some decorative slits in the top to vent steam. Bake for 55 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until serving. A traditional sour cream pie plus gooseberries for a tart sweet treat.  Much better than raisin any day!
Pick over the dried beans, and soak them in water overnight. The next day, drain off the soaking water, and place the beans in a large pot or slow cooker. Cover with water, and stir in the dried garlic and onion, salt, bay leaf, sugar, cayenne pepper, celery seed, cumin, and crushed red pepper flakes. Push the ham hock down into the beans. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer over low heat for 3 to 4 hours. Stir in the smoked sausage, simmer for 20 more minutes, and serve. This recipe was given to me by my sister. It's a hearty dish, and wonderful for the cold winter months. To make a little meatier, I cut up a small ham steak in cubes and add the cubed ham the last 20 minutes. Serve over cooked rice. 
In a cocktail shaker, shake together vodka, hazelnut liqueur, Irish cream liqueur, and coffee flavored liqueur with several cubes of ice. Strain into a glass filled with ice cubes. This splendid mixture of liquors that everyone has in the back of their liquor cabinet collecting dust looks like chocolate milk, but is far from it. My friends and I came up with it one night when we did not have the right ingredients for another drink. All of our ladies said that it should be a regular drink at all our parties.
Combine beef, onion, cracker crumbs, Worcestershire and egg in a large bowl.  Mix well with hands or a spoon. Shape meat into 6 rectangular mini meatloaves, each about the size of a deck of cards (3-1/2 by 2x1/2 by 1/2-inch thick). Heat oil in a wide skillet over medium-high heat; brown meatloaves 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside. Drain fat from pan. Add sauce and brown sugar to pan. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer over medium heat 3 minutes, stirring frequently until slightly reduced.  Return meatloaves to pan and spoon sauce over tops. Simmer, uncovered, over medium heat 5 minutes or until cooked through. Serve meatloaves and sauce with mashed or roasted potatoes, if desired. Mini meatloaves are browned in a skillet then simmered in a sweet tomato sauce glaze for a quick weeknight preparation.
Place the salsa, taco seasoning, lime juice, and cilantro into a slow cooker, and stir to combine. Add the chicken breasts, and stir to coat with the salsa mixture. Cover the cooker, set to High, and cook until the chicken is very tender, about 4 hours. If desired, set cooker to Low and cook 6 to 8 hours. Shred chicken with 2 forks to serve. This is a nice change from plain chicken tacos.  The cilantro really adds a burst of flavor to this recipe.
In a small bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the cereal to the cheese then add the juice to the mixture until it holds together.  Stir in milk until the cereal is pasty but not lumpy. For the little ones that are either teething or don't have enough teeth this cereal is nice and mushy but sticks to a spoon very well.  It's easy to eat and tasty. If my toddler is any judge, it's scrumptious, too! You may substitute cranberry juice for the grape juice if you wish.
Heat olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat; cook and stir onions and carrots until onions are slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Melt butter with onions and carrots; cook and stir zucchini and garlic in the melted butter until onions are translucent, about 7 more minutes. Stir beer, seafood seasoning, parsley, garlic powder, chile-garlic sauce, sea salt, oregano, and black pepper into the vegetable mixture and gently lay catfish fillets over top of vegetables. Pour tomatoes with their juice over the vegetables and catfish. Cover pot and bring to a simmer; cook until catfish are cooked through, about 10 minutes. Break the catfish fillets apart into bite-size chunks. Pour in a tomato can of water and stir in corn; simmer the chowder covered until vegetables are tender and flavors have blended, at least 30 more minutes. Thick and spicy chowder, full of veggies! Serve with a warm and crusty loaf of bread!
Peel, core, and grate the apples. Cream together 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup butter or margarine.  Stir in the grated apples and eggs. Sift together flour, salt, soda, nutmeg, and cinnamon; mix into the apple mixture.  Pour batter into an ungreased 9 inch glass pie plate. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes.  Remove from oven. Place 1/2 cup butter or margarine, 1 cup sugar, 1/2 cup cream, and vanilla in the top pan of a double boiler.  Heat and stir until sugar has dissolved and butter or margarine has melted.  Serve over apple cake. This recipe for a cake made with fresh apples makes great brunch dish served with a creamy butter sauce.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Beat cake mix, water, eggs, and vegetable oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until cake mix is moistened, 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and beat until batter is thoroughly combined, 2 minutes. Pour into prepared baking pan. Bake cake in the preheated oven until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing from pan to finish cooling. Crumble cake into a large bowl and mix crumbs with vanilla frosting. Pinch off about 2 tablespoons of cake crumb mixture and roll into a ball about 1 inch in diameter. Repeat with remaining cake mixture. Place cake balls onto parchment paper-lined baking sheet and freeze for 15 minutes. Pour candy sprinkles into a bowl. Melt 4 blocks of vanilla almond bark in a small saucepan over low heat and stir until coating is melted and smooth. Insert a lollipop stick into a cake ball and slowly and carefully dip the cake ball into the melted coating, spinning the cake ball slightly to get an even, smooth coat. Cover the entire ball and about 1/4 inch of the lollipop stick where it meets the ball. Repeat dipping remaining cake balls, melting additional coating as you work. Decorate each cake ball with candy sprinkles by dipping or applying as desired; place lollipop handles into styrofoam block and let coating harden. Work quickly; coating will set in a minute or so. Mini cake and frosting balls coated in a hard shell, finished with a sucker stick for a bite-size dessert treat!

Bring a pot of lightly-salted water to a boil; cook the ravioli in the boiling water until tender, about 5 minutes; drain. Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the hot skillet until brown. Stir in the sage, thyme, cayenne pepper, chicken broth, and pumpkin pie filling; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 10 minutes. Ladle over drained ravioli to serve. More like a ravioli with pumpkin sauce, this is a wonderful mix of sweet and spicy. If it is too sweet, use a can of solid packed pumpkin in place of the pumpkin pie filling and use more broth and some pumpkin pie spice. I've made it both ways, and both are great. My husband preferred it with the pumpkin pie mix. Modify the cayenne pepper to taste; we like it spicy so we use 2 teaspoons!
Mix milk and vinegar together in a measuring cup or bowl; let sit until thickened, about 5 minutes. This is a recipe that will tell you how to make buttermilk by using ingredients that are already in your kitchen. Use in recipe of your choice.
Crush cookies in 2 or 3 batches in a food processor. Pulse until you get fine crumbs, about 30 seconds per batch. Transfer to a bowl. Place cream cheese, butter, and confectioner's sugar in food processor; mix until smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk milk and pudding mixes together in a bowl until pudding is thickened; fold in whipped topping. Stir in cream cheese-butter mixture. Press 1/3 of the cookie crumbs onto the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. Sprinkle half of the gummy worms on the crumb layer. Spread half of the pudding mixture over the crumbs and candy. Carefully layer another 1/3 of the crumbs over the pudding mixture and sprinkle on more gummy worms. Add the last layer of cookie crumbs and smooth them out for your "pumpkin patch." Place pumpkin candy in rows with enough room to for frosting "vines" and "leaves." Tint frosting with green food coloring and transfer to piping bag. Connect pumpkins with "vines" and add swirling tendrils. Switch to a leaf tip and create some leaves. I was bringing a dessert to a 'spooky Halloween dinner,' and wanted to make something creative. I had heard of the 'dirt cup' recipes with gummy worms before, but I wanted to do something a little different, so I adapted the recipe to this! Kiddos loved it and so did the adults!
Bring medium pot of water to boil. Add peaches and blanch for 30 seconds. Drain and transfer to medium bowl. Cover with cold water and cool. Drain, peel and slice. In a medium bowl, combine peaches, blackberries, strawberries, honey and cardamom. Toss together and refrigerate. This is a fabulous late-summer fruit salad. Use it on pancakes, waffles or French toast.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Lightly grease cookie sheets. Using a pastry blender or food processor, cut butter into cream cheese. In a small bowl, sift dry ingredients together except for confectioners' sugar. Work dry ingredients into butter/cream cheese mixture until you have an even, mealy texture. Knead to form a stiff dough. If the dough gets too soft, refrigerate for about five minutes before continuing. Roll dough to 1/4-inch thickness. Using a cookie cutter or glass, cut into about 3 inch diameter cookies.  Keep re-rolling dough until you have used it all.  Use your thumb to make a depression in each cookie. Place a 1/2 teaspoon of filling in the depression. Bake for about 20 minutes (until lightly golden).   Let cool on a cookie rack.  Dust lightly with confectioners' sugar.

Roast cauliflower steaks in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Gently turn over each steak and brush with remaining olive oil mixture. Continue roasting until tender and golden, 15 to 20 minutes more. You might've tried boiling, mashing, and even turning cauliflower into 'rice'. For a different take on cauliflower, try these oven-roasted cauliflower steaks seasoned with a simple lemon-garlic sauce. Serve the steaks with chimichurri sauce or topped with roasted cherry tomatoes, sliced green olives and crumbled feta cheese.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan, and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover, and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Add the broccoli and steam until just tender, 2 to 6 minutes depending on the size of the broccoli florets. Remove the broccoli to a serving bowl and toss with butter, add salt and pepper to taste. Heat the tuna, teriyaki sauce, and garlic powder in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until the tuna has heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour the tuna over the broccoli and serve. This was something experimental that I came up with the other night because I was hungry and had a can of tuna leftover from lunch. This is something that you can also experiment with and tweak it to fit your personal tastes, it's great when you're in a time crunch.
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain, and reserve the drippings.

Transfer the mixture into a large stockpot. Heat a small amount of the reserved bacon drippings in the skillet again over medium-high heat. Cook the pork chops in batches in the hot drippings until evenly browned on both sides. Use additional bacon drippings for each batch as needed. Remove the pork chops to a cutting board and blot excess fat off the surface of the chops with a paper towel; cut into bite-sized cubes and stir into the bacon mixture. Heat a small amount of the bacon drippings in the skillet; cook and stir the bell pepper in the hot drippings until softened and fragrant; drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Stir the cooked pepper into the bacon mixture. Pour the tomatoes with liquid and beef broth into a stockpot and place the pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until the stew begins to thicken, stirring occasionally, about 90 minutes. Stir the sour cream into the stew just before serving. Bring a pot with lightly-salted water and bring to a rolling boil; add the egg noodles to the water and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Ladle the stew over the drained noodles to serve. A flavorful stew, Pörkölt is redolent with the fragrance of paprika and bell peppers. It has few ingredients, and is surprisingly easy to make. Save time by using boneless pork chops and cubing them after they are browned. There should be enough salt in the canned tomatoes to season the stew, but if not, add more to your taste. Use best-quality, real Hungarian paprika for best results. We prefer to serve it with noodles, but galuska (Hungarian dumplings) or rice are good, too.

In a small saucepan, bring water and sugar to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in honey. Cool completely. Place apple in a blender, and liquidize them with juice of 1 lemon and the cooled sugar syrup until as smooth as possible. The peel will add texture, and prevent the mixture from being completely smooth. Transfer the mixture to an ice cream machine and freeze according to directions. Leave the sorbet out to soften 10 minutes prior to serving. This is the sorbet I served on Rosh Hashana meal between first and main course. It is white flecked with bright green, tangy from the green apples, and sweet with honey. Fresh and fabulous. Shana Tova! I recommend eucalyptus blossom honey, easily found in Israel.

Refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to blossom. This piquant chutney is not as sweet as traditional cranberry sauce. The bite of the fresh ginger will become more pronounced as the chutney rests. If you have any left after Thanksgiving, try it in turkey sandwiches with a smear of cream cheese. Oh. My. God.

Add chicken to the sauce, cover skillet, decrease heat to low, and simmer while oven preheats, 5 to 10 minutes. Arrange chicken atop the onion layer and pour sauce over chicken and vegetables. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, 20 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of chicken should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle Parmesan-Romano cheese over chicken.

Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes, and stir in the coconut milk, thyme, black-eyed peas, and green onions until well combined. Lay the cabbage chunks on top of the mixture, and place the remaining half chile on top of the cabbage. Cover, and simmer until the rice and cabbage are tender, about 20 minutes. Check occasionally to see if the mixture is getting too dry on the bottom, and add a small amount of water if needed to prevent burning. Before serving, stir in butter, and season to taste with salt and pepper. My grandmother's recipe. It's delicious and can be made with or without meat. It's also very versatile.

Cover dip with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour. My dad would stop at our local store's deli each holiday just to purchase the dried beef cheese ball he loved. One year after tasting a similar style, I decided to mix the two together and came up with this dip. It is in honor of my dad who 'had to have' his cheese ball every year! This version is now a staple at all our family gatherings! Serve with crackers or bagel chips. You can use low-fat or fat-free versions of the cream cheese, sour cream, and cheddar cheese to lower calories and fat.  I would not recommend fat-free cheddar cheese though.

Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat until hot. Break off pieces of the dough and shape into a patty - kind of like a flat biscuit. Place just enough of the dumplings in the pan so they are not crowded. Fry on each side until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels before serving. Flat fried buttery dough usually served with cod fish in Jamaica, as a big weekend breakfast, slightly different from the American dumplings.

When my family moved away from Seattle, one of the things we missed the most was a pasta dish from one of our favorite restaurants. I worked to recreate it from a number of similar recipes, but it required some improvisation because there's nothing like it. The garlic is an integral part, and if you love the stuff, you can dial it up to a full bunch. The true Roman-style is without grated Parmesan on top, but if you love the stuff, it's fine with as well.

Beat in eggs one at a time. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. An easy poppy seed Bundt cake that is quick AND delicious.
Preheat an electric griddle or fry pan to medium-high, about 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in the buttermilk, 1/2 cup at a time, until the mixture forms a very sticky ball of dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and knead gently 8 to 10 times. Pat the dough into a circle about 1 1/2 inch thick, and cut the circle into quarters. Place the wedges onto the preheated griddle and cook until the bottom is golden brown, about 15 minutes; turn over and cook the other side until golden, another 10 to 15 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a wedge should come out clean. Stand the wedges on a wire rack to cool, then cut each wedge in half and slice horizontally for serving. My grandma made this every weekend to go with her traditional big Irish breakfast.  It's cooked on an electric griddle and cut into toast-sized slices that can be eaten buttered, toasted, or fried crisp in the bacon drippings. Serve with butter and jam or fry insides down on hot pan with bacon drippings for a minute until golden and crispy.  Unfried pieces can be toasted on the second day, but won't keep longer then that. 
Cream shortening and sugar.  Add molasses slowly, stirring constantly.  Mix spices with cream of tartar and add to mixture. Mix baking soda and buttermilk. Add alternately with the flour to the sugar and spices mixture. You may not need the whole 9 cups of flour but you should end up with a fairly stiff dough. Chill dough overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Roll dough out to at least 1/4-inch thick (the thicker the better), using as little flour as possible.  Keep dough refrigerated when not rolling and cutting.  Cut into cookies and brush with beaten egg. Bake for 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Alternately, you can form the dough into golf ball size round, roll in white sugar, place on a cookie sheet and then flatten slightly. This recipe is at least 175 years old. It has been in my family forever, it just gets handed down from one generation to the next. Makes good gingerbread men.
Place eggplant in a microwave safe bowl and microwave on medium-high 3 minutes. Turn eggplant over and microwave another 2 minutes. The eggplant should be tender, cook another 2 minutes if the eggplants are not tender. Drain any liquid from the eggplants and mash. Combine cheese, bread crumbs, eggs, parsley, onion, garlic and salt with the mashed eggplant. Mix well. Shape the eggplant mixture into patties. Heat oil in a large skillet. Drop eggplant patties one at a time into skillet. Fry each side of the patties until golden brown, approximately 5 minutes on each side. Patties can be frozen before frying and cooked later. This recipe is one of many I have discovered to utilize the bountiful eggplant crop my garden has produced this year.  The kids will even love eggplant this way!
In a large bowl, mix together peanut butter, cream cheese and sugar. Then stir whipped topping into peanut butter mixture. Whisk until smooth and no lumps remain. Pour filling into pie crust and refrigerate for about 3 hours until pie is firm. This pie is so smooth and creamy that it will melt in your mouth!  It's always requested by my family members for its ultimate peanut butter flavor.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the flour, brown sugar, oats, and cinnamon together in a bowl; cut the butter into the mixture until crumbled. Combine the yams and cranberries in a larger bowl. Stir 1 cup of the flour mixture into the yams and cranberries; pour the mixture into the bottom of an 8-inch square baking dish and top with the remaining flour mixture. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes; top with the marshmallows and return to the oven until the marshmallows are browned, about 10 minutes more. This dish was a staple at the Thanksgiving table when I was growing up. I looked forward to this over everything else. Can triple recipe to make a 9x13-inch baking dish.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place 1 tablespoon of the butter or margarine in a 9 inch round cake pan and place in oven to melt. Once the butter or margarine has melted remove the pan from the oven and stir the brown sugar into the melted butter or margarine. Spread to coat the bottom of the pan evenly. Arrange the peach slices in the pan and set aside. Separate the eggs. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Set aside. Cream the remaining 8 tablespoons of the butter or margarine with the white sugar. Beat in the egg yolks, then the milk and the vanilla extract. Stir the graham cracker crumbs, baking powder, and salt together. Beat the graham cracker mixture into the egg yolk mixture. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, over the top of the peaches. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 40 minutes. Remove cake from oven and immediately invert the cake upside down onto a large plate. Because this cake is so moist, it should be stored in the refrigerator. Makes about 8 servings. This cake is different twist on the usual pineapple upside down cake.  It is a wonderful cake served anytime, everyone will love it.
In a saucepan bring water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes. In a large skillet over medium heat, saute the garlic and shrimp for about 5 minutes or until pink. Pour in broth, tomatoes and saffron; bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Stir in 2 cups of the cooked rice and reduce heat to low. Cook for an additional 5 minutes. This is a simple paella that is fast and tastes great.  I even got my kids to eat it.
Combine eggs, olives, roasted red peppers, and capers in a bowl. Stir mayonnaise and curry powder into egg mixture; season with salt and pepper. This curried egg salad is kicked up a notch with olives, capers, and roasted red peppers.
Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Gradually add the white sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Fold in the almond meal, cinnamon, lemon zest, and vanilla. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer the meringue to a piping bag with a large plain tip (or a gallon-sized plastic zipper bag with the corner snipped off). Pipe the meringue into ladyfingers about 3 inches long. Set the pan aside and let the meringues dry at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat an oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Bake the cookies on the middle oven rack until dried but not yet brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow them to cool completely. Make the filling by creaming the butter and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Stir in the vanilla. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in the top of a double boiler over just-barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. To assemble the cookies, spread buttercream on the back of a cookie, sandwich it together with another cookie, and dip both ends in the melted chocolate. Let the dipped cookies dry on waxed paper or parchment. Delicious traditional Dutch almond meringue cookies filled with butter icing and dipped in chocolate.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Drain. Thaw the broccoli in a microwave oven until you can break it apart into small pieces. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the diced ham in the hot oil until the edges start to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the broccoli and cook and stir until any excess water has cooked away and the ham and broccoli are hot. Pour in the jar of Alfredo sauce and the milk; stir to blend, sprinkle with pepper, and add the cooked pasta. Stir everything together to coat the pasta with sauce and bring to a simmer. Spread the bubbling pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish, top with shredded Colby-Monterey jack cheese, and bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is hot and the cheese is melted and starting to brown, about 30 minutes. This quick, week-night dinner is a nice alternative to mac and cheese with ham.  It comes together easily and is comforting and filling.
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; stir in couscous and salt. Remove from heat, cover saucepan, and let stand until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Transfer couscous to a bowl and fluff with a fork. Mix tomatoes, cucumber, onion, parsley, mint, lemon juice, olive oil, and black pepper into couscous. Serve immediately or refrigerate for 1 hour for flavors to blend. This is a great vegetarian option to pasta salad. Great summertime recipe to accompany BBQ chicken or grilled meat.
Place the potatoes in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook until tender. Remove from heat, drain, and put through a ricer or mash. Place the riced potatoes onto a large clean work surface. Crack the egg over the top, then gradually work in the flour with your hands until you get a nice stiff dough. You may not need to use all of the flour, or you may need to use more. This could take as long as 30 minutes, or just seem like it. Let the dough rest for a minute before rolling. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. You may need to roll out 1/2 at a time. cut the dough into 8x8 inch squares - larger or smaller depending on the size of your peaches. Wrap each peach in a square of dough, and pinch all of the seams to seal it in. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Place the peach dumplings into the water. The peach should be as close to covered with the water as it can get. We usually had 2 or 3 pots with boiling water because you can only fit about 3 to 4 peaches per pot.  Boil for 20 minutes, rotating after 10 for even cooking. Remove from water using tongs or a large slotted spoon. To serve, place a peach dumpling onto a plate, and cut it up. Remove the pit, and sprinkle with melted butter, sugar and vanilla wafer crumbs. My dad used to make the best Peach Dumplings. Some people make them with a bread dough. My dad made his with a potato dough. The peach was wrapped in the dough and dropped into boiling water to cook. When they were served you would cut them up and sprinkle them with crushed vanilla wafers, sugar and melted butter. We ate them as a meal even though they sound like a dessert. Again, there are different ways to serve them: my friend's mother sprinkled hers with ricotta cheese and sugar.
Stir chocolate pudding and whipped cream together in a bowl. Add about 10 gummy worms. Divide chocolate ice cream between 5 bowls. Spoon chocolate pudding over ice cream and top each with sprinkles and remaining gummy worms. I have enjoyed this year after year every Halloween since 5th grade. You can have this yummy treat anytime you have a chocolate craving. A great kid friendly Halloween party snack!
Spread the graham cracker crumbs onto a small, shallow plate. Moisten the rims of 2 martini glasses with the lime wedges; reserve the lime wedges. Dip the moistened glasses into the graham cracker crumbs and set aside. Reserve the lime wedges and remaining graham cracker crumbs to use as a garnish. Pour the vodka, melon liqueur, pineapple juice, almond syrup, and whipped cream into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the rimmed glasses. Place a lime wedge on the edge of each glass and sprinkle the cocktails with some of the reserved graham cracker crumbs to garnish. This really does taste like Key Lime Pie! It's very sweet and refreshing and a favorite with my girlfriends!
In a large saucepan, combine 3 cups mashed kiwi, pineapple juice, lemon juice and apples.  Bring to a boil and then add the sugar; stir to dissolve, reduce heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Mashed kiwi, pineapple juice,  lemon juice and sugar, with apples as a pectin source.
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs with butter and milk. Sprinkle yeast overtop and allow to soften for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, sift together 5 cups flour with 1/2 cup sugar, salt, and ground cardamom. Once yeast has softened, stir flour mixture into milk mixture until a soft dough forms. Cover bowl with a towel, and allow to rise in a warm spot for 30 minutes. Sift together flour and baking powder. Stir into risen dough, then knead until smooth. Form into 16 balls (or 24 if you'd like smaller semlor) and place onto greased baking sheets. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, 35 to 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown and the center has firmed. Cool buns on a wire rack to room temperature. Once cool, cut a slice about 1/2 inch thick off of the top of the bun and set aside. Scoop or cut out the center of the buns, leaving a shell about 1/2 inch thick. Tear the removed bread into small pieces and place into a bowl. Moisten the bread with milk, then mix in marzipan until smooth. Add additional milk if needed until the marzipan filling is nearly as soft as pudding. Whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar to stiff peaks. Fill each shell with a spoonful of marzipan filling. Pipe whipped cream on top of the filling to 1/2 inch over the top of the bun. Replace the tops onto the buns, and dust with confectioner's sugar before serving. These Swedish desserts are traditionally served on Fat Tuesday, but nowadays they are happily eaten as often as they can be found. We love that these are not too sweet, and are just big enough.
Cut the cucumber in to quarters lengthwise then slice thinly and place into a bowl. Cut the cantaloupe into thin pieces the same size as the cucumber and place into the bowl. Season with the chili oil, rice vinegar, salt, and sugar. Mix well then sprinkle with sesame seeds to serve. Sweet, crunchy, delicious! This salad is easy to make and easy to eat. It's great as a snack or side-dish.

In a large bowl thoroughly mix together, ground beef, ground pork, rice, chopped onion, fresh parsley, egg, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Lightly pack a small amount of meat mixture and place in the center of the cabbage leaf. Fold sides over the filling and start at the stem and roll the cabbage up until the meat is encased. Repeat with remaining leaves and filling. Cut the leftover leaves into pieces and place into the bottom of a roasting pan. Layer the stuffed cabbage rolls over the cut leaves. In a bowl, mix the tomato sauce, reserved cabbage water, white vinegar, and white sugar. Pour the tomato sauce mixture over the cabbage rolls. Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven until the ground beef mixture is no longer pink in the center, about 2 1/2 hours. Baste stuffed cabbage rolls every hour. Halupki, also known as stuffed cabbage on the Russian/Ukranian side of my family, is a dish made of rice, beef, and pork encased in cabbage drizzled with a thin, sweet tomato sauce. My grandma Eugenia is 98 and she taught me how to make this comfort food classic. Every family has their own twist on this traditional dish. I hope you enjoy these with mashed potatoes just as we always do in my family!
Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat, then whisk in the flour to form a thick paste. Slowly whisk in the milk until the mixture resembles a thick sauce. Stir in the tomato soup, Cheddar cheese, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and paprika until heated through, about 10 minutes. Add more milk if the soup becomes too thick. Delicious lunch.

Lay bread slices into batter, one at a time, and let bread absorb the mixture. Turn bread slices in batter until almost all batter has been absorbed, about 10 minutes. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and melt butter in the hot skillet. Cook bread slices in the hot butter until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer French toast slices to a baking sheet. Lay ham slices into the hot skillet and cook until meat begins to brown, about 1 minute per side. To assemble, place a Cheddar cheese slice on a slice of French toast, top with 2 slices of ham, and lay a Havarti cheese slice over ham. Bake in the preheated oven until French toast pieces are no longer wet, the batter is set, and cheese has melted and begun to brown, about 20 minutes. Place sandwiches on serving plates and top each with 2 poached eggs. Season with kosher salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Imagine the best French toast you've ever had, combined with the best ham and cheese sandwich you've ever had, topped with perfectly poached eggs. You don't need any Hollandaise because the poached egg yolks are the sauce.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease rimmed baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Combine brown sugar, cumin, cardamom, coriander, ginger, salt, and cayenne pepper in a bowl and mix well. Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, skin sides up.

Decorate with sprinkles or colored sugar.  Re-roll trimmings and cut into shapes until all of the dough has been used. Bake on lightly greased cookie sheets for 8 to 9 minutes. This is a really good tea cake that is easy to make.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir anchovy and capers in hot oil until anchovy crumbles, about 2 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour white wine, oregano, and red pepper flakes into the skillet and increase heat to high; cook until mixture reduces and about 3 tablespoons of liquid remain, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir tomatoes into the skillet and bring to a simmer. Season tomato mixture with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Stir tuna and 1/4 cup parsley into tomato sauce, breaking up tuna with a wooden spoon while stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 10 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until almost cooked through and still slightly firm to the bite, 9 to 11 minutes. Drain and transfer spaghetti back to the pot. Pour tomato sauce over spaghetti into the pot; stir to combine, cover the pot with a lid, and let sit until spaghetti is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Ladle spaghetti into bowls, drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil, and sprinkle Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and parsley over the top. Spaghetti al tonno is one of my all-time favorite go-to pasta dishes. I love a classic meat sauce as much as the next half-Italian, but when I want something quick and easy for a weeknight meal, I reach for the tuna. What if you don't like fish? Then this is perfect. The taste and texture is really closer to a veal sauce than one made with fish.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Arrange the tomatoes on a baking sheet with the cut sides facing up. Roast the tomatoes in the preheated oven until cooked through and slightly browned on the underside, about 15 minutes.

Once the squash is cool enough to handle, scrape in strands into a large bowl with a fork; season with salt and pepper and toss with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir the garlic, basil, and Italian seasoning in the oil until the garlic is softened, about 10 minutes. Add the onion, green bell pepper, eggplant, and carrot to the garlic; increase heat to medium. Continue cooking and stirring until the vegetables are nearly tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Mix the tomatoes and white wine into the vegetable mixture; cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the spaghetti squash; gently toss together. This dish leaves even the biggest pasta lover satisfied. Fresh vegetables make this dish wonderful and it's easy to add meat to if you wish. The first time I made it, my husband fell in love and everyone wanted the recipe. This dish is great topped with a small amount of shredded cheese. I recommend Gouda.
Place eggs in a  large pot and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes.

In a saucepan, combine the vinegar, water, salt, pickling spice, most of the onion (reserve a couple of slices), and black peppercorns. Bring to a rolling boil; pour over the eggs in the jar. Place a couple of slices of onion on top and seal the jars. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for 3 days before serving. This wonderful picked egg recipe is quick and easy.  Perfect for a nice gift, or just to have on hand for entertaining.  Plan ahead though, they need to be refrigerated for at least 3 days before they're ready for eating.

A great, fairly quick recipe for a delicious hoagie bake.
Dissolve lime, blueberry, and cherry gelatin mixes with boiling water in a bowl. Stir cold water into gelatin and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours. Unmold gelatin by dipping bowl in hot water until gelatin loosens; invert bowl over a platter to release. Decorate top of gelatin with gummi worms and flowers. This weird dark brown gelatin dessert looks like a mound of soil with flowers and worms sticking out. Kids will love it.
Mix together the chicken and mayonnaise in a bowl, stir to coat well, then stir in the green onions, dried cranberries, apple, pecans, lime juice, salt, pepper, and dill weed. Serve immediately, or refrigerate several hours or overnight (the flavor just gets better). This is a great sandwich filling that they make at the diner in the hospital where I work, but I fancied it up a bit with some green onions and pecans. A great way to use up leftover chicken. Delicious!
Mix oats, chocolate chips, sunflower seed kernels, cranberries, protein powder, peanut butter, flax seed, and honey together in a large bowl using your hands to assure ingredients are well integrated. Stir milk into the oats mixture with a spoon until the mixture is even in texture; divide and shape mixture into 10 balls. I have been looking for a long time for a protein bar, or at least something close, that didn't taste either flat or just plain-old bad. I tweaked this one to get around my tree-nut allergies and finally have the recipe I'd been seeking!  These are yummy, and my teenage daughter even likes them! Store refrigerated.

Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve. This is a great make-ahead dish from Marcia C. Adams of Fort Wayne, Indiana. It took the top $10,000 prize in the National Chicken Cooking Contest in Dallas, Texas. It sounds weird, but it is good.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. Cream together butter and confectioners' sugar until smooth. Stir in vanilla. Mix in the flour, and then one cup of the chocolate chips. Shape dough into 2x1/2 inch logs. Place logs 2 inches apart on prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 13 minutes in preheated oven, or until firm. Let cookies cool completely before removing from pan (shortbread is brittle). Melt the remaining 1 cup chocolate chips and shortening over a double boiler, stirring frequently until smooth. Dip one end of each cookie into the chocolate, then into the nuts. Place onto waxed paper until set. Delicious shortbread logs with chocolate chips in the cookie and dipped in chocolate and nuts on the end.
Stir sugar and blueberries together in a bowl; let stand for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir lemon juice and pectin together in a separate small bowl; add to blueberry mixture. Stir constantly until sugar is completely dissolved and no longer grainy, about 3 minutes. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the blueberry into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/2 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Let stand at room temperature for 24 hours until set. Refrigerate for up to 3 weeks or freeze for up to 1 year. Thaw in refrigerator. A quick and easy way to enjoy your favorite fruit freezer jam.

Bring liquid to a boil and cook until ground beef is cooked through and carrots are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir potatoes, remaining onion, and celery into tomato mixture and cook until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove stockpot from heat and let sit, 20 to 30 minutes. This basic recipe uses simple and often used ingredients. It can be spiced up any way, but our spices we have found bring out the best flavor and they are the key to this recipe. Ground pork or ground lamb can be substituted for ground beef. It can also be cooked on the stovetop, which we do, or slow cooker. Eat as a stew or serve over rice, crushed chips or crackers, or cornbread.

Remove sirloin from marinade and discard marinade. Thread sirloin, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and onion onto skewers. Cook on the preheated grill until sirloin is browned and vegetables are tender, about 4 minutes per side. I had some sirloin that I had to use up and couldn't find a recipe that I liked, so I made one up! I didn't have any tortillas to make traditional fajitas so I just put them on a stick! I use the fajita marinade for lots of different recipes with any kind of meat, including shrimp and fish.

Use rubber gloves to handle the young walnuts and pierce each one a few times with the tines of a fork. Watch out for the clear juice this produces. It stains a dark, espresso brown and is a natural dye. Place the walnuts into a bucket and fill with enough water to cover. Stir in 3/4 cup of salt to make a brine. Soak walnuts for 1 week, then drain and make the brine again. Soak for 1 more week. After the second week, drain the walnuts and lay them out on trays to dry in an airy place. In a couple of days they will turn black. Once they have all turned black, they are ready to pickle. In a large pot, stir together the malt vinegar, brown sugar, allspice, cloves, cinnamon and ginger. Bring to a boil and then add the walnuts. Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Spoon the walnuts into sterile jars and fill with the syrup to within 1/2 inch of the top. Seal with lids and rings. Store in the refrigerator or process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes. Cool to room temperature and store in a cool dark place.

Sprinkle with salt and black pepper, and mix in the tomato paste, chili powder, and cumin. Allow the mixture to simmer until the spices are fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat. Stir in the browned ground beef, black beans, kidney beans, corn, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese until well combined. Adjust salt and pepper if necessary, and spread the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and cover the dish with foil. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling in the center, 20 to 25 minutes; remove the foil, return to oven, and bake until the cheese is browned, 5 to 10 more minutes. Sprinkle the remaining green onions (green tops) and cilantro over the top. Great way to use up the ever-plentiful summertime squash. Very flexible recipe. Definitely a very yummy family favorite. Love to serve it over rice or millet. It can be easily adjusted to suit your tastes. I have used shredded cooked chicken in place of the beef. I have also added other garden veggies that I needed to use up.
Stir refried beans and taco seasoning mix together in a bowl. Place soft cream cheese in a separate bowl and stir until the cream cheese is workable; thoroughly mix in the prepared guacamole. Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spread with 1/2 cup of bean mixture in a smooth, even layer; top with 1/2 cup of guacamole mix in a layer. Roll up the tortilla into a log and moisten the far edge with a little water to seal. Wrap rolled tortillas tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, 1 hour to overnight. To serve, unwrap the rolls and trim off the uneven edges of each roll; cut into 1-inch pieces. Place a piece into each cupcake paper and insert a red pepper strip into the end for a wick. Sprinkle appetizers with chopped green onion. I needed something to bring to my niece's 4th of July party. I wanted something portable, simple to make, and of course really tasty! I love Mexican food so this recipe in inspired from south of the border, yet created in New England. You can adjust the heat on the recipe by using a hotter or milder taco seasoning.
In a large stock pot cover potatoes with enough water so they are fully covered.  Bring to boil, then reduce to a simmer. In a saute pan cook onion and bacon, over medium heat, until onions are soft.  Add to potato mixture. Once potatoes become soft, and the broth has a milky look to it, add cut up fish fillets.  Heat until fish fillets are cooked through. Add enough milk product to bring soup to your desired taste and texture.  Season with white pepper and serve. If you cannot use russet potatoes, go for the Maine potatoes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar and margarine until well blended . Press mixture into a 9 inch springform pan.

Prop door open and cool in oven for an additional 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely. Refrigerate for as long as possible before serving. This recipe was passed down from my husband's grandmother. You will love this New York-style cheesecake. The longer it's refrigerated, the better. Enjoy!
In small saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir the walnuts and sugar until walnuts are lightly browned and sugar is caramelized. Thoroughly coat the walnuts with the sugar. In a blender or food processor, blend the beets with cider vinegar, bouillon granules, garlic powder, sugar, salt, and pepper. Gradually blend in the oil. In a large bowl, toss together the sugar-coated walnuts and spinach. Before serving, drizzle with the blended beat mixture, toss, and sprinkle with goat cheese. I tried this salad in Rehoboth Beach, DE and vowed to duplicate it! It is so addicting with the crunchy sugared walnuts and creamy goat cheese. The vinaigrette is to die for. I don't even care for beets! Great for holiday dinners. A must try!
Combine ground pork, Italian sausage, ground sirloin, and ground chuck in a large bowl. Mix them with your hands until thoroughly combined. Soak bread chunks in chicken broth in a bowl until completely soft. Combine garlic and parsley in a mini chopper or food processor and grind to a fine paste. Squeeze the excess broth out of the bread, reserving the broth in a bowl, and add the bread to the meats along with the garlic and parsley paste. Gently mix in beaten eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese with your hands until fully incorporated into the meat mixture. If the mixture seems dry, pour in some of the reserved chicken broth. Pinch off golf ball-sized pieces of the meat mixture and roll them into meatballs, taking care not to pack them too tightly, and set them on a baking tray. Depending on how big you make them, you should end up with about 30 meatballs. Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in two or three batches, brown the meatballs on all sides and drain on paper towels. If you're adding them to a pot of sauce, you may undercook them slightly, as they will finish cooking in the sauce. Fry the meatballs in oil and butter--they're great just like that. Or if you are going to add them to a pot of sauce, leave them slightly undercooked so as to not overcook them in the sauce. If you're adding them to the Meat Gravy, put them in about 1 hour before serving.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Put margarine in a pie dish and melt in the preheating oven. Mix eggs, flour, and milk in a bowl; pour over melted butter. Arrange peach slices atop the egg mixture. Sprinkle sugar over the peach slices. Bake in preheated oven until the pancake is firm in the center, about 30 minutes. A great alternative to the everyday pancake. This recipe calls for sliced peaches, but any fruit can be substituted. Try bananas and chocolate chips for a special treat.
Combine the chicken, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger, bay leaves and peppercorns in a Dutch oven. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Once it boils, reduce heat to a simmer. Cover the pot and simmer for 30 minutes, basting the chicken occasionally. After 30 minutes, remove lid and cook until liquid has reduced to half. Remove chicken from the pot to a serving plate. Strain the liquid from the pot to remove all the food particles, and set aside. Serve chicken hot over steamed rice and drizzle with reserved sauce. This is considered the Philippine national dish. The combination of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, ginger and peppercorns is delicious and actually preserves the chicken! Great for picnics.  My mother taught me how to cook this, using her variation from the original recipe. A delicious, cheap and easy dish! Serve it hot with hot steamed Jasmine rice.
Combine chicken, vegetables and broth or wine in a medium saucepan over medium low heat. Stir all together and let simmer until heated through. In a small bowl beat cornstarch into evaporated milk and add to chicken mixture. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and pepper to taste, unless leftover chicken has enough of its own seasoning already. Serve hot. I make this with leftover chicken, and serve it over biscuits or pastry shells. A good way to use up leftovers that won't quite stretch by themselves!
Use kitchen shears to cut down both sides of the backbone. Remove backbone and discard. Cut through breastbone from the inside until chicken folds out like a book and lays flat. Season chicken all over with salt and black pepper, and sprinkle herbes de Provence on the inside. Let chicken sit for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature; pat dry with paper towels. Brush skin-side of chicken with oil and season again with salt and black pepper. Heat an oven-proof cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot, about 5 minutes. Place chicken, skin-side down, in hot skillet and place bricks evenly on top to weigh down chicken. Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove bricks, turn chicken over, and continue roasting until juices run clear and meat is no longer pink at the bone, 5 to 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Preheat the oven's broiler and broil the chicken until skin is crispy and golden, 1 to 3 minutes. You should use a big cast iron pan for this, but it will also work in a high-quality, heavy-duty stainless steel pan, or other oven-proof skillet. The key is to heat it very well before the chicken goes in. Other than that, there's really no way to screw it up, unless you under or overcook it, which won't happen, since you're going to check it with the thermometer.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish. Spread about 2 tablespoons of pesto per chicken breast over the top of each breast, and wrap each breast in prosciutto slices to cover the entire breast. Place the wrapped chicken breasts into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink, the juices run clear, and the prosciutto is lightly crisped, about 25 minutes. A simple way to prepare chicken that looks like you spent a lot of time preparing. It can also be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated until baked. Be sure to use a good quality pesto for best results. I like to serve it with pasta, but it is also nice sliced and served on a green salad.
In a shallow bowl, mix together flour, paprika, and salt and pepper. Dredge chicken pieces in the seasoned flour. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and saute chicken until light golden brown (about 45 seconds each side). Remove chicken from skillet, and set aside. To skillet, add mushrooms, lemon juice, and chicken stock. Simmer until a smooth, light sauce develops. Season with garlic powder. Return chicken to the skillet, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Stir in artichoke hearts, and remove from heat. This variation on the original uses mushrooms and artichoke hearts as a tasty twist. Yum! Serve over pasta or rice. White wine or water may be substituted for chicken broth.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spread pecans evenly on a baking sheet. Toast for 8 to 10 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant. In a small bowl, stir together the vinegar, mustard, sugar, salt, and pepper; mix until sugar and salt dissolve. Whisk in olive oil. In a salad bowl, toss together the greens, cranberries, pecans, onions, and cheese. Drizzle with vinaigrette, and toss gently to coat. Raspberry Dijon vinaigrette is savory with cranberries, toasted pecans, red onion, and feta cheese.  A real crowd pleaser!  Can substitute brie for feta, too.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a cookie sheet with foil, and spray with non-stick cooking spray. In a medium bowl toss the red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, eggplant, and squash with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Arrange on the prepared cookie sheet.

Heat olive oil and remaining jalapeno half in a large skillet over medium heat; swirl oil to coat skillet evenly. Season tilapia fillets with salt and pepper. Pan-fry fish strips in the skillet in 2 batches until fish is golden brown and easily flaked with a fork, 5 to 6 minutes. Discard jalapeno half. Heat tortillas in the microwave on high until warm, 20 to 30 seconds. Serve fish in warmed tortillas topped with cabbage slaw, reserved sour cream mixture, and cilantro. This simple yet scrumptious recipe has a nice kick and is a house favorite. Delicious!

In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Cover and let set in a warm place for 15 minutes, or until yeast is creamy. Place 2 1/2 cups flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture. Pour in the oil and stir until the flour is combined and a loose dough has formed. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead in the remaining flour as is necessary to keep the dough from sticking. Knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.  Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces and form into oval rolls. Place the rolls on a lightly greased baking sheet.

I like to use all pork for my city chicken; however tradition is to use pork and veal combined.  The grocery stores around me sell a pack of cubed pork with the wood skewers already in the pack  specifically for city chicken, so you may want to look for that first.  But, if you can't find that, then cubing your own pork will work fine.

Bake cookies in the preheated oven until partially cooked, 11 minutes. Place raspberry jam in a bowl and stir until syrup consistency. Press a soda bottle cap into the center of each cookie until edges of cookies bulge and begin to crack, making an indentation. Fill each indentation with about 1 teaspoon jam. Bake cookies until edges are lightly browned, 7 minutes longer. Cool cookies completely on the baking sheet before transferring to a wire rack. These cookies are great for kids of all ages. I usually double the recipe when I make them. Using a cookie scoop and soda bottle cap to make the indentations results in uniform cookies, which makes a nice presentation. But you can improvise with other lids; just aim for something about the size of a quarter. Use any variety of jelly, but I do not recommend jelly with chunks of fruit, like strawberry. Attempting to move the cookies prior to cooling completely will cause them to break.
Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select cycle; press Start. Applesauce is the reason this bread is so moist and tender. It's a snap to make in your bread machine too!

Spread each piece of bread with cream cheese mixture and top with a cucumber slice. Top each canape with a few fresh dill leaves. These easy, beautiful, yummy sandwiches are perfect for brunches, tea parties or spring and summer lunches. Can be prepared ahead of time and assembled just before serving. This is an easy appetizer to prepare the day before, except for the assembly. The cream cheese mixture is actually better after about 8 hours. Feel free to experiment with the dressing; we prefer the buttermilk dressing but ranch or Italian works great, too. Also, cocktail bread can be substituted for the hand-cut bread, which will save 10 to 15 minutes.

Fill a large pot partially with lightly salted water, and place the chicken in the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cook the chicken until the meat is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. Remove the chicken from the broth, and crack open the carcass to allow the chicken to cool. Reserve the chicken broth. After the chicken has cooled enough to handle, pick the meat from the bones, and set aside. While the chicken is simmering, make a roux by whisking together the flour and vegetable oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook and stir the mixture, watching constantly to avoid burning, until the roux is a rich chocolate brown color, 20 to 30 minutes. As soon as the roux has reached the desired color, stir in the onions, bell peppers, celery, Cajun seasoning, and bay leaves, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes. Pour in the reserved chicken broth, diced tomatoes, and beef sausage, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mixture has thickened, about 1 hour.

Cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Puree vegetable mixture using a stick blender until smooth. Alternatively, pour vegetable mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Mix pureed vegetables, ground beef, and egg together in a bowl with your hands until evenly combined. Divide meat mixture into 10 equal portions; form each into a mini-loaf and place on prepared baking sheet. Place 1 bacon piece on top of each loaf. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Gluten-free, grain-free, nut-free, these little meat loaves are delicious, even without ketchup! After pureeing the vegetables, use a wooden spoon to help combine with the meat. I find that if the meat is right out of the refrigerator it will cool the vegetables down enough to handle fairly soon. Don't add the egg to hot vegetable puree or it will cook!
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-low heat; cook and stir onion with a pinch of salt until lightly browned and caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Add figs and balsamic vinegar to onion; cook over medium heat until vinegar is reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Season fig mixture with salt and pepper. Spread spinach onto serving plates and top with fig mixture and Gorgonzola cheese. Surprisingly light but decadent-tasting salad. The balsamic reduction provides enough moisture so that no additional salad dressing is needed. Serves 2 entree-sized salads or 4 small appetizer salads.
Cut the bread and place on a wire rack to dry out a little as you prepare the batter. Whisk the egg to blend. Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a saucepan or on the stovetop and allow to cool slightly. Whisk the sugar, salt and spices into the egg. When the butter has cooled slightly, slowly drizzle it in to the egg, whisking all the time. A little at a time, add the flour to the egg mixture to make a smooth thick paste. After it is all added, slowly blend in the milk and finally the vanilla. Whisk until just smooth and set aside. Heat the remaining butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip a slice of the bread in the batter and allow to soak for 30 seconds, no more. Remove from the batter and allow the excess to drip off, back into the bowl. Place the battered slice in the skillet. Repeat with the remaining slices. Cook until golden on one side and then flip to brown the other. Serve immediately--a fresh squeeze of lemon juice and a good dusting of powdered sugar is traditional. Yes, this is French toast, but a superior one. Unlike normal French toast this batter cooks into a custardy, crispy coating that leaves the bread creamy and oh so good. The use of good egg bread is a must here. Homemade is best, however store bought (such as Hawaiian bread) will work in a pinch.
Heat a large soup pot over medium-low heat; add olive oil and heat until it starts to smoke. Decrease heat to low and add onion, bacon, celery, garlic, and rosemary to the hot oil. Cover pot with a lid and cook until onion is tender and bacon is cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix squash, carrot, paprika, and cayenne pepper into onion-bacon mixture; return lid and increase heat to medium-low. Cook squash mixture, stirring occasionally, until squash is softened and nearly cooked through, about 20 minutes. Pour chicken stock over squash mixture and increase heat to medium-high; cook until squash is cooked through, about 10 minutes more. Remove pot from heat and cool soup slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Blend soup using an immersion blender until smooth; season with salt and pepper. Add more chicken stock for a thinner soup. A simple, comforting, and delicious pumpkin squash soup. Drizzle heavy whipping cream over soup and sprinkle finely chopped celery leaves and finely sliced green onion for garnish.
Place the beef into a container and cover with water. Soak overnight in the refrigerator to remove excess salt. Drain, rinse, and cut into small cubes before using. Bring the cubed beef, peas, and water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the peas have softened and mostly dissolved, about 30 minutes. Stir or whisk frequently to help the peas dissolve, and to keep the soup from burning on the bottom of the pot. Stir in the carrots, turnips, and black pepper, continue simmering until the vegetables have softened, about 15 minutes more. This is a tasty soup made in the traditional Newfoundland style.  One bowl of this soup with never be enough, it is delicious!

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 1 hour or until a toothpick insert near the center comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove bread from pan and let cool on a wire rack. My mother used to make this recipe in a long loaf pan which I don't believe they make any more.  Fortunately, I have her pan and whenever I make this it sure brings back such happy memories.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the salt, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, coriander, and turmeric together in a small bowl; set aside. Rub the steaks on all sides with the seasoning mixture. Cook on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). This seasoning makes any steak awesome. This is the best. It doesn't overpower the steak. I can't eat a steak out anymore because I always compare it to this seasoning.
In a large non-skillet, saute the tenderloins. Salt and pepper to taste. Add the mushrooms, red bell peppers and yellow bell peppers and cook until vegetables are tender.

Cook over medium low heat, stirring constantly, until the sauce begins to thicken. Add garlic salt and ground black pepper to taste. Blend in the Swiss and Parmesan cheeses and continue heating, stirring constantly, until the cheeses melt. Stir in the chicken/vegetable mixture and heat thoroughly. Toss with the cooked pasta and top with grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. You can also substitute ham or turkey for the chicken. This dish was named for Luisa Tetrazzini, a well known, well FED turn-of-the-century Italian singer!
Salt the rims of 2 large margarita glasses. To do so, pour salt onto a small plate, moisten the rims of the glasses on a damp towel and press them into the salt. In a pitcher combine limeade, pineapple juice, orange juice, tequila and orange liqueur. Stir well and pour into the glasses, being careful not to rinse off the salt. My husband was a bartender for a trendy restaurant when we met.  Here's one of his home versions! Garnish with a lime wedge or an orange wedge.

Broil the stuffed peppers until blistered and hot, about 4 1/2 minutes per side. Serve with sauce. My wife and I came up with this recipe on a whim. It has since become one of our family's favorite recipes. I feel I must warn you though, once you make this for your family you will likely be making it again and again. Enjoy! Whatever green peppers you decide to use, make sure they are at least 6 inches long and 3 inches wide. 
Place the bread cubes into a large bowl. Heat the milk until it starts to bubble at the edges, then pour it over the bread cubes. Stir briefly to coat the bread.  Let soak for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onions; cook and stir until tender. Stir in the parsley, and remove from the heat. Mix into the bowl with the bread along with the eggs, salt and pepper. Use your hands, squeezing the dough through your fingers until it is smooth and sticky. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. The water should be at least 3 or 4 inches deep. When the water is boiling, make a test dumpling about the size of a small orange or tangerine, by patting and cupping between wet hands. Gently drop into the boiling water. If it falls apart, the dough is too wet. In this case, stir some bread crumbs into the rest of the dumpling batter. Form the remaining dough into large dumplings, and carefully drop into the boiling water. Simmer for 20 minutes, then remove to a serving plate with a large slotted spoon. They should come out soft, spongy and delicious! My Bavarian Oma made these large dumplings to accompany roast pork or game dishes, any meat with gravy, or with mushrooms in a creamy sauce. Serve one dumpling alongside your dish, and cover with a little gravy.

As a Canadian, growing up in Toronto's Little Italy, this soup was always on someone's stovetop somewhere in the fall and winter months. Pasta, beans, and a thick broth, sprinkled with Parm or Romano, and served with fresh crusty Italian bread - what's not to love? I spent a lot of time, back in the day, in the cucina with my friends and their mothers learning the basics of good Italian food!
Combine chicken stock, summer savory, basil, thyme, chipotle powder, salt, black pepper. parsley, and sherry in a stock pot; bring to a boil. Add carrots, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until carrots are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Melt butter in a skillet. Cook and stir celery, onion, and garlic in hot butter until onions are translucent, about 5 minutes; stir into stock mixture. Add turkey, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until turkey is hot and has flavored the soup, about 30 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain and add to soup. Season with salt and black pepper to serve. Make good use of your leftover dark meat without the fuss of boiling the carcass. Simply pick through the carcass before you toss the bird and save the meat for a quick next-day soup. Serve with warm bread for a great hot meal on a cold winter day. I substitute fresh herbs wherever possible, but for a quick meal after the intense preparation of a whole turkey, dried herbs do nicely. If you don't have chipotle chili powder, regular chili powder can be substituted. The chipotle provides a very light smoky flavor in the background. White meat can be used, but your broth will be less flavorful. Leftovers freeze well. Use whatever type pasta you prefer.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Add broccoli florets and asparagus to the boiling water during the last 5 minutes. Drain, and run under cold water to cool. In a large serving bowl, stir together the diced chicken, kidney beans, black olives, green pepper, cherry tomatoes, feta cheese and Italian dressing. Stir in the pasta, broccoli and asparagus. Season with salt and pepper to taste. I like it pretty heavy on the pepper. This salad is best if chilled for a couple of hours before serving. This Pasta salad is a nutritious and light summer meal or side dish. My 4 yr old loves the veggies in this. I regularly use up grilled leftovers (chicken and veggies) in this salad.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.

I use only one egg yolk and all three whites from the three hard-cooked eggs, but adjust to your own taste.
Place potatoes in a medium pot and fill with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until fork-tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, cover, and set aside. While the potatoes are cooking, heat the extra virgin olive oil in a large skillet on medium high.  Rinse the trout fillets and pat dry. Season the trout with the dried Italian seasoning and salt and pepper. Gently place the trout in the heated oil and pan fry without moving the fillets for 10 minutes. Carefully turn the fillets. Arrange the bell pepper and onions on top of the trout and cook for 5 minutes. Then, place the anchovies, olives, tomatoes, capers, and parsley on top of the fillets. Pour in the white wine and simmer for an additional 5 minutes. Serve the trout and vegetables on a bed of steamed potatoes. A wonderful exotic dish fit for kings.

Place half of the mango slices into the bowl of a blender with the coconut milk.  Blend until smooth and reserve for later. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat.  Stir in the curry paste, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add the chicken and shallot; cook until the chicken is done and the shallots have softened, about 5 minutes.  Pour in the mango puree, and cook until heated through.  To serve, stir in the remaining mango slices and cucumber. I love Indian food, this recipe developed after falling in love with the dish at a small family owned Indian restaurant near my home. After tweaking a few things, I think I have come up with a great copy-cat version.  The curry paste can easily be substituted with the mild version for those with more sensitive palates.  Serve over Basmati rice. I hope it meets your liking.  Enjoy!
Heat the butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add the corn and onion and cook for 3 minutes or until browned, stirring occasionally. Add the rice and cook and stir until the rice is lightly browned. Stir the garlic and broth in the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 25 minutes or until the rice is tender. Season to taste. Rice is a regular at most dinner tables, so keeping this side dish fresh and exciting can be a challenge. Adding the sweet taste of onions and pan-roasted corn only takes another minute or two, but adds incredible texture and flavor.
Put chicken breasts into a slow cooker crock. Stir apricot preserves, Russian-style salad dressing, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; pour into slow cooker crock, assuring chicken is completely covered. Cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream the butter with 1/2 cup of the confectioners' sugar and the vanilla. Mix in the flour, pecans, and salt. Roll about 1 tablespoon or so of dough into balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake in preheated oven until bottoms are golden, about 15 minutes. Do not allow these cookies to get too brown: it's better to undercook them than to overcook them. While cookies are still hot, roll them in confectioners' sugar. Once they have cooled, roll them in confectioners' sugar once more. These are technically Mexican Wedding Cakes or Russian Teacakes, but my grandmother gave up on us calling them that years ago!
In a large bowl, combine beef, egg, onion and salt. Mix together, then shape into little balls. In a slow cooker combine chili sauce, lemon juice and grape jelly. Stir in meatballs and cook on high for  4 to 5 hours. Meatballs in sweet and sour sauce.

Spread melted chocolate over the cooled toffee. Immediately sprinkle with about 1 cup of the remaining sliced almonds. Freeze for 1 hour, or until firm. Turn the toffee out onto a work surface, and break it into 1/2 inch pieces. Let the ice cream soften very slightly in a large bowl. Stir briefly, just until malleable. Fold in the toffee pieces. With a large rubber spatula, spread the ice cream into the crust. Top with the remaining almonds. Place the pie in the freezer. When it has firmed up slightly, cover the top with plastic. Freeze until firm, about 6 hours. Place the pie in the refrigerator to soften about 20 minutes before serving. Run the tip of a knife around the sides of the pie to loosen. Carefully remove the sides of the springform pan. Cut into wedges with a knife dipped in hot water. This is an easy pie to make, with spectacular results. Make sure to use the best ice cream to get the best flavor; I like Starbucks® coffee flavor, and Ben and Jerry's®.

A mildly spiced cream cheese and crab mixture. Pour cocktail sauce over the chilled ball, and serve with crackers.  Sinfully delicious!
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk garlic, lime zest, rice vinegar, fish sauce, lime juice, chile pepper sauce, and sesame oil in a glass bowl. Brush both sides of sea bass fillets with vegetable oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. Cook on the preheated grill until fish is opaque, shows good grill marks, and springs back when pressed lightly, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer fillets to a serving platter. Whisk dressing again; taste and and adjust seasoning. Drizzle dressing over warm fish. Sprinkle fillets with cilantro leaves. While this recipe for grilled sea bass with an Asian chile-lime dressing is super-fast and easy, it doesn't taste or look super-fast and easy. Your guests will be impressed, and it will be our little secret. I served mine with some caramelized parsnips.
Line a plate with a paper towel; place a layer of 2 or 3 slices of eggplant onto the towel. Sprinkle eggplant with sea salt. Repeat layers of eggplant sprinkled with salt until all eggplant slices are stacked. Place 2 paper towels onto the stack and place a plate on top of the towels. Lay a heavy book or can of food onto the plate to squeeze out moisture. Allow to drip for 20 minutes to 2 hours. Rinse and pat dry. Beat eggs with milk in a shallow bowl. Place bread crumbs into a separate bowl. Dip eggplant slices in the egg mixture and gently press into the crumbs to coat; set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking dish. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry eggplant slices in the hot oil in small batches until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. Pour about 1/4 cup of marinara sauce into the bottom of the prepared baking dish and arrange a layer of eggplant slices to cover the sauce. Scatter basil and a few slices of smoked mozzarella cheese over eggplant; repeat layers, ending with a layer of sauce on top. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and the cheese has melted, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately. The heavenly, salty, slightly sweet combination of rich tomato-y marinara, crispy creamy fried eggplant, and smoked mozzarella. I'd call this dish transcendent.
In a large bowl, combine sugar, milk powder, creamer, cocoa and instant coffee. Mix together until well blended.  Store in a sealed container. To serve, Heat a cup of water per serving (or milk, for a creamier taste.)  Stir in 2 to 3 heaping teaspoons of cocoa mixture. A nice creamy hot drink mix for both kids and adults!  A snap to make! Nutmeg or cinnamon may be added, if desired.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place chicken in skillet, and cook 10 minutes, or until juices run clear. Drain, and transfer to the prepared casserole dish. Mix with mayonnaise, water chestnuts, pimentos, almonds, celery seed, and lemon juice. Season with garlic salt to taste. Layer with cheese, and top with French-fried onion rings. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until cheese is melted and onion rings are lightly browned. If rings start to get too brown, put foil on casserole or lower oven rack. Watch carefully, or onion rings will burn. This delicious chicken casserole is a favorite of my family and friends. I think it's the combination of flavors in this dish that make it so spectacular. Great served over rice with a nice salad and some good bread.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Blend in flour, salt, pepper and 1 cup of half-and-half. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring, until thick. Stir in turkey, onion and bread crumbs. Mix well, then shape mixture into 8 small patties and refrigerate to chill for 30 minutes. Place cornflake crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl and place remaining 1 cup half-and-half in a second shallow dish or bowl. Heat oil in skillet. Dip patties in crumbs, then in cream, then in crumbs again; brown patties in the hot skillet, place in a serving dish and cover with soup. Great way to use leftover turkey! A mixture of chopped turkey meat, flour, crumbs, onion, and cream formed into patties, browned and topped with creamy soup for serving.
Heat the oil in a large pot with a lid over medium heat. Cook the onion and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the ginger to the mixture and cook another 2 minutes. Stir the oyster sauce into the mixture; cover and cook another 2 minutes. Pour the water into the mixture, cover, and cook another 2 minutes. Add the clams; cover and cook until the majority of the clams have opened, about 5 minutes. Discard any clams which do not open. Serve immediately. Clams, such as Manila or baby clams, taste great cooked in oyster sauce, and make a great appetizer.
Remove giblets from chicken cavity, rinse chicken inside and out. In a large stock pot or container, mix water, sage, celery seed, thyme, salt, sugar and soy sauce to create brine. Stir well until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Place the chicken in the brine, cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove chicken from the brine and rinse well inside and out. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of seasoned salt. Bake the chicken at 400 degrees F for 45 minutes. Brining a chicken with soy sauce makes a juicier and more flavorful chicken. Great for baked, grilled or fried chicken.
Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Fry ginger in hot oil until fragrant, then add pork, soy sauce, dark soy sauce, salt, and sugar. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Stir in the sesame oil, green onion, and rice wine. Simmer until the pork is tender. A simple Chinese dish.  The wine and ginger gives the dish its fragrant smell.  Best served with warm rice.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). In a bowl, beat together the egg and milk. In a resealable plastic bag, mix the flour, mesquite seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. Dip the steak pieces in the egg mixture, then place in the plastic bag, seal, and shake to coat. In the hot oil, fry the coated steak pieces in small batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Tired of the same old chicken nuggets? Give these a try! Feel free to 'play' with the seasonings, but this is how my family likes them. Serve hot with barbeque sauce or salsa for dipping.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-low heat and lightly oil grate. Place the ears of corn on the grill and cook until the kernels are tender, about ten minutes turning frequently. Remove the ears from the grill and cool. Cut the kernels off of the cob. Fill a large saucepan with lightly salted water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add asparagus and cook until just tender, about 1 minute. Drain in a colander and rinse immediately under cold, running water until well chilled. Set aside. Combine the corn, asparagus, roasted peppers, garlic, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve at room temperature or chilled. A simple, sweet and enjoyable taste of summer.  This salad is great served as a side dish, or serve with nacho chips.
Place 1/2 cup of brown sugar into a saucepan along with the dates and apricots; pour in the apricot nectar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook, stirring constantly, until the nectar has mostly evaporated and the mixture is sticky, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; set aside. Grease a baking sheet. Stir the melted shortening and vanilla extract into 1 cup of brown sugar in a large bowl until no lumps remain. Stir in the flour mixture and oats; work well with your hands until the mixture is evenly combined. Press half of the oat mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Spread the cooled apricot mixture evenly over the oats, then press the remaining oat mixture evenly over top. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Cool completely before cutting into bars and serving. This recipe goes way back; I grew up loving these bars. I entered this in the Jefferson County Fair on August 28, 2010. It won First Place.
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the beets, 1/4 of the chopped garlic, and the olive oil on a piece of heavy aluminum foil; fold the foil around the beets into a sealed packet. Roast beets in the preheated oven until easily pierced with a fork, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Let beets cool just until they can be handled, then rub with a paper towel to remove skins. Chop into 1/2-inch cubes; set aside. Heat the peanut oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bok choy and the remaining garlic together until bok choy is slightly softened but still crunchy, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in the beets and the feta. Serve warm. Straying from bok choy's usual Asian flair, this lovely bright pink salad has a rich feta flavor with a fresh clean finish. The bok choy provides a nice crunch while the beets keep the tones earthy, with the feta and garlic to sharpen the flavor.
Stir water and quinoa together in a rice cooker; cook until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook eggs to desired doneness; season with seasoned salt and pepper. Combine quinoa and eggs in a bowl; top with avocado and feta cheese.

In a glass bowl, toss shrimp with teriyaki sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for one hour. Adjust oven rack to the middle setting and set oven to preheat. Remove shrimp from marinade and place each on a half strip of bacon with a water chestnut. Roll and secure with a toothpick, then place onto a broiler pan approximately 1/2 inch apart from each other. Discard remaining marinade. Broil ramakis for 5 minutes on each side, or until the shrimp is pink and the bacon is cooked (keep the oven door ajar and watch carefully). Drain on paper towels and serve immediately. Shrimp marinated in teriyaki sauce are wrapped in bacon and broiled until crisp. Serve with white rice and steamed vegetables.
Mix brown sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, thyme, oregano, and cayenne pepper together in an airtight container, seal, and shake. A delicious rub to use on any type of meat.
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, mix together red bell peppers, onion, white wine vinegar, sugar and crushed red pepper flakes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to simmer. Stirring occasionally, cook 30 minutes, or until thickened. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight before serving. Spread cream cheese on your favorite crackers and top with this zesty relish. Red bell peppers and sweet onion are simmered in white wine vinegar and red pepper flakes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch pan. Mix cake batter according to package directions, adding water, oil, and eggs as directed. Spread batter into prepared pan and bake in preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool and crumble.  Make pudding, according to package directions, with milk. In a large trifle or other glass serving bowl, place half of the crumbled cake. Pour half of the coffee over the cake, and spread half of the pudding over that. Top with half of the whipped topping, sprinkled with half the crumbled candy bars. Repeat layers in the same order. Refrigerate until serving. I make this while I'm cleaning the kitchen after dinner--layers of German chocolate cake, toffee candy, and whipped topping.
In a small bowl, stir together 1/2 cup warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the top, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until foamy. Place flour in a large bowl, and stir in salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in the corn oil and yeast mixture. Add the remaining water in small amounts until you have a soft moist dough that can be handled.  Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead for at least 5 minutes. Return to the bowl, cover with a towel, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Deflate the risen dough, and divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball. On a lightly floured surface, roll each ball with a rolling pin so it is oval shaped, about 6 inches long, and 1/2 inch thick. Use a fork or dull knife to draw three lines on the top of each loaf. Place the loaves on a baking sheet. Mix together the egg and remaining tablespoon of water; brush the tops of the loaves with the mixture. Sprinkle caraway seeds over the tops, if using. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until the loaves are shiny and golden brown. This is an easy bread recipe that results in a soft, tender flat bread. My native Afghani friend says that this bread tastes better than the traditional Arabic bread she buys at the store. Enjoy!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring 3/4 cup water to a boil. In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 1/4 cup cold water. Whisk this mixture into the boiling water. Reduce heat and stir until mixture is thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir butter or margarine and aspartame into cornstarch mixture. Add cinnamon and nutmeg if desired. Mix well. Place fruit in a large bowl and pour aspartame mixture over fruit. Toss until fruit is thoroughly coated. Pour fruit into pastry lined pie pan. Cover with second pastry shell. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top. Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, until crust is golden brown. This is a sugar free fruit pie that is very good.  I've served it before and no one guessed it was sugar free. You can use any kind of fruit you like. Apples, cherries or  peaches work best.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place 1/4 of vegetables in center of a sheet of foil.  Drizzle with butter; top with basil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Bring up sides of foil over vegetables; fold down two times.  Double fold both ends of foil to seal packet, leaving room for heat circulation inside.  Repeat to make four packets.  Place packets on baking sheet with 1-inch sides. Bake 15 to 18 minutes on the cookie sheet. Open packets carefully by cutting beside top fold with a sharp knife, allowing steam to escape.  Sprinkle 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese over vegetables in each packet. Yellow squash and Roma tomatoes with fresh basil are baked in foil packets for the flavors of summer--and easy clean up.
Put collard greens in a pot full of lightly salted water; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until tender, about 1 hour. Drain. Cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon on paper towels. Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in melted butter until tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir bacon, chicken bouillon, water, garlic, oregano, thyme, and savory into the onion; bring to a boil. Stir collard greens into the mixture and simmer 5 minutes. Pour milk over the mixture, stir, and cook another 5 minutes. A delicious collard green recipe that goes well with any soul food or poultry entree.

Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Allow to set for 5 minutes, until cheese melts. This is an easy to make recipe that is great for potlucks, church gatherings, holidays, or outside gatherings. It is also a non-hassle recipe for you working folks, single folks, or even for kids to make! You can even make it ahead of time by preparing the casserole and then freezing it - for up to 3months! My family loves this casserole and we change things around in it, by adding or taking out different things. Have fun with it, and I would love to hear comments on what worked for you and what changes you made! Serve with dinner rolls or French bread and a salad!
Heat the port wine over medium heat until just below the simmer point in a large stockpot with a lid. Add bourbon and rum, and bring back to just below simmering. Save the bottles and their caps for storing leftover glogg. While the wine and liquors are heating, place the cardamom, cinnamon stick, cloves, and orange peel onto the center of the square of cheesecloth. Gather together the edges of the cheesecloth, and tie with kitchen twine to secure. When mixture is very hot but not boiling, carefully light it with a long-handled match.  Wearing a heatproof cooking mitt, carefully pour the sugar into the flames, and let the mixture burn for 1 minute.  Put the lid on the stockpot to extinguish the flames, and turn off the heat.  Let the mixture cool, covered, for about 10 minutes; add the cheesecloth bundle of spices and the raisins and almonds to the warm wine mixture and let it cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Strain the cooled glogg and reserve the raisins and almonds. To store, pour strained glogg into the bottles, recap, and keep upright in a cool dark place for up to 1 year.  Refrigerate the steeped raisins and almonds in a covered bowl or jar for up to 1 year. To serve, pour glogg into a saucepan and warm over low-medium heat until hot but not simmering, about 5 minutes.  Ladle 3 ounces of warmed glogg into a small coffee cup or small Swedish-style glogg mug, and garnish each serving with a few reserved raisins and almonds. My grandfather brought this recipe over from Sweden in 1921. We still use it today. God Jul.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a medium bowl, stir together the 3 cups of flour with the confectioners' sugar.

In a smaller bowl, stir together the egg whites and white sugar. Add the flour and baking powder, mix until lumps are gone. Stir in the lemon juice. Pour the lemon mixture over the baked crust, then sprinkle the remaining crust mixture evenly over the top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven. Refrigerate to set before serving. This is a variation of the Lemon Bars I used to make.  I preferred the lemon filling to be between the layers of dough so I altered my recipe.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Saute onion in skillet over medium heat in oil until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and chiles, let cook 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in spinach, cheese, cream cheese, half and half, and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Spoon mixture into shallow baking dish like a 9 inch quiche dish or pie plate. Bake in the preheated oven until the dip is bubbly and the top is light brown, about 35 minutes. Good 'n' spicy. Not your typical spinach dip recipe. No artichokes, here! Serve this tasty treat with tortilla chips.
Heat the potatoes and broth in a 6-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Cover and cook for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Stir the vinegar, onion, mustard, sugar, bacon, and parsley in a large bowl. Pour the potato and broth mixture into the bowl with the vinegar mixture and stir to coat. Let stand for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season to taste.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour a 2 quart souffle or casserole dish. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in the eggs one at a time. In a separate bowl combine the citron, prunes, raisins and pecans.  Stir in the flour and toss so that everything is coated with flour. To the butter mixture add the fruit and nut mixture along with the bread crumbs, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  Mix well and transfer to prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until well browned. This recipe calls for prunes, which are dried plums. I hope this will be what you are looking for! 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes. Drain, and cool. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.  Cook the bacon, onion, and garlic until bacon starts to crisp and onion and garlic have softened, about 5 minutes.  Remove from heat and drain. Mix the bread crumbs, cream cheese, parsley, and the bacon mixture in a large bowl; season with pepper to taste. Pour the tomato puree into a large, shallow casserole dish; stir in the rosemary. Spoon the bacon and breadcrumb mixture equally into the pasta shells. Arrange the stuffed shells in the casserole dish. Coarsely chop the mozzarella and scatter over the pasta shells.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Move oven rack into the top third of the oven. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and spread the zucchini slices into the skillet in a single layer. If they don't fit, cook them in batches. Sprinkle pieces of garlic over the zucchini, and cook until the zucchini are golden brown on both sides, about 8 minutes per side. Remove from heat. Arrange the slices of zucchini in an 9x12-inch glass baking dish, alternating with slices of mozzarella cheese and tomato, so that the slices overlap each other in a neat row pattern. Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese and basil over the dish, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and brown and the dish is bubbling, about 30 minutes. A quick and easy vegetarian dish for two, or a starter for 4, or even a side. A rustic Italian favorite, taught me by my Roman friends. If serving as a main, then crusty bread, torn off the loaf by hand, and a green salad with a lemon and/or lime vinaigrettey dressing cannot be bettered. 
Mix the paprika, garlic powder, brown sugar, dry mustard, and kosher salt together in a small bowl; spread evenly over the pork roasts. Refrigerate the seasoned roasts at least 3 hours. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place pork roasts into a large roasting pan. Bake the roasts in the preheated oven until pork is tender and shreds easily with 2 forks, 4 to 6 hours. Shred the pork and place into a large pot over medium heat. Mix the meat with the barbeque sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the flavors have blended, about 30 minutes. This is an excellent dish for backyard parties, Super Bowl (or any sports) parties and get-togethers. Serve with rolls or French or Italian bread. Goes great with corn on the cob.
Mix pineapple, sugar, and eggs together in a saucepan; bring to a slow boil. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking until mixture thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir gelatin mix into pineapple mixture. Set aside to cool. Line a pie dish with enough vanilla wafers to cover bottom. Beat milk in a large bowl using an electric mixer until thickened, about 3 minutes. Stir gelatin mixture into whipped milk and pour over vanilla wafers. Refrigerate until set, about 8 hours. My mom made this when we were kids and we all loved it. It is a pie that when you say 'jello pie' you can remember the taste and want some. It's easy to make, refreshing to eat, and everyone will enjoy it.
Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, onion, and carrots. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent and the carrot has softened, about 5 minutes. Scrape into a blender, and add the habanero peppers, jalapeno peppers, tomatoes, oregano, parsley, salt, pepper, and vinegar. Blend until smooth and pour back into the saucepan. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside until cool; pour into a bottle and refrigerate. Tomato and oregano-based hot sauce. 7 of 10 on the heat scale. Lots of flavor without being too overbearing.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place 2 cups Parmesan cheese into a shallow bowl. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Dip chicken breasts into the beaten egg whites. Press chicken into Parmesan cheese in shallow bowl to coat both sides. Gently toss between your hands so any cheese that hasn't stuck can fall away. Place the chicken on prepared baking sheet. Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Meanwhile, heat Alfredo sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and red pepper flakes in a large saucepan over low heat. Allow to simmer while you finish the remaining steps. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat; cook and stir mushrooms and spinach until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir vegetables into the sauce. Place the penne pasta into a serving bowl; slice chicken breasts and arrange over the pasta. Pour sauce over the pasta and chicken, and sprinkle remaining 1 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Penne pasta in a red pepper-flecked tomato cream sauce tossed with mushrooms, spinach, and topped with Parmesan chicken. I also serve with a fresh Caesar salad.

Place the mahi mahi fillets in a shallow dish and coat with teriyaki sauce. Cover, and marinate for at least 1 hour. Prepare a grill for indirect heat. If using charcoal, arrange and light coals under one half of the grill. Sprinkle lemon juice over the fish fillets and season with chipotle seasoning, red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce. Place the fillets on the plank. Place the plank on the grill over direct heat. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Move the plank with the fish over to indirect heat (the cooler part of the grill), cover and cook for 10 more minutes or until fish can be flaked with a fork. Top fillets with mango salsa and serve hot. The delicate flavors of the fish are richly enhanced by the sweet tang of the wood planks. The mango salsa gives it a spicy flair. Just about any fish will work--I have used tilapia and it turns out well. This is great served with rice pilaf.

Crisp cucumber, enoki mushrooms, and tomatoes are topped with a rich bacon, onion, and mustard salad dressing in this hearty salad.
Heat the oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Place cod in the bag, and gently shake to coat. Place eggs and crushed pretzels in two separate shallow dishes. Dip coated cod in the eggs, then in the crushed pretzels. Fry coated fish 10 minutes in the preheated oil, turning once, until golden brown and easily flaked with a fork. The pretzels add a great crunchy coating that sticks to the fish when frying. The flavor is excellent and these fillets serve well alone or as a fish sandwich.
Bring the brown rice, and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 45 to 50 minutes. Prepare a skillet with cooking spray and place over medium heat. Cook the bell pepper and onion until lightly browned; stir into the cooked rice.

It's cheesy because it has fat-free Cheddar cheese.  And, it's delicious because all of these flavors blend together to make a delicious side dish!
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat until it begins to foam. Cook and stir the celery, onion, and red bell pepper in the hot butter until soft, about 10 minutes. Stir the half-and-half and parsley through the vegetable mixture; season with salt and black pepper. Continue cooking until the mixture just begins to boil; add the oysters and any liquid from the can to the stew along with Louisiana-style hot sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the oysters begin to curl, 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove the saucepan from heat and allow the stew to sit 5 minutes before serving. Oyster Stew has always traditionally been served by my mother and her Hollingsworth family roots from Georgia every Christmas Eve. The colors of red and green are very Christmas-like. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
Partially peel cucumbers lengthwise, leaving thin green stripes around the cucumber. Halve cucumbers lengthwise. Scoop seeds from cucumber halves with a spoon. Discard seeds.

This simple technique not only provides you with a NY strip steak that eats like a filet mignon, but the trimmings are used to make a world-class pan sauce. Even if a faux-bordelaise isn't your cup of tea, you can always save the scraps for a Sunday sauce or meatballs. The overnight 'dry-aging' step is optional, but does add a little something extra to the final product.

Place the plums, a few at a time, into a colander set over a large bowl. With gloved hands, squeeze the plums in the colander, forcing the juice through the holes of the colander. Discard spent pulp, and repeat to produce 8 cups of plum juice. Pour 3/4 cup of plum juice into a small saucepan with garlic and onion, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour the juice-onion mixture into a large pot, and add the remaining 7 1/2 cups of plum juice. Stir in the sugar, apple cider vinegar, Southwest chipotle seasoning, roasted garlic seasoning, jalapeno pepper, salt, and liquid smoke flavoring until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the sauce down until thickened, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir frequently to prevent burning. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the sauce into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area. When plums are in season, this is a great alternative to putting up jam with all those plums.  This is a great addition with pork, chicken, or as a topping on cream cheese served with crackers.

I created this sauce in my own kitchen with ingredients I already had in my cupboard. The results are delicious and it has become a staple in my home. This recipe can easily be doubled. Try using it for dipping katsu chicken and egg rolls, or use it as a substitute for barbeque sauce. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

Drop by 1/4 cupfuls 3 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are golden. Allow cookies to cool for 1 minute on the cookie sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely. These cookies are really chewy and addictive.
Blend yogurt, coconut milk, cocoa powder, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and almond extract in a blender until smooth. Pour into ice pop molds to 3/4 full. Fill remaining space in each mold with cherries, and push cherries down into cocoa mixture with a knife to evenly distribute. Freeze until solid, at least 8 hours. Chocolate yogurt, frozen with cherries. Awesome. Ice pop molds are all different sizes and shapes. Use your experience to decide if you should alter the amounts. Recipe, schmeshecipe.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the cumin and ground red chilies, and cook for a few seconds until the spices are fragrant.

Lower heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vegetables and lentils are tender, about 30 minutes. Add more water if needed. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan. Pour cooked vegetables and lentils into the prepared pan. Gently layer biscuits atop the vegetables. Sprinkle with Colby Jack cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are bubbling and cheese is browned, 20 to 40 minutes. This melange from underground veggies is a great way to use up those leftover biscuits from brunch before they turn into hockey pucks. But if you don't have leftover biscuits, it works well to use biscuits from a can or quickly whip up your favorite family recipe!
Stir together the yogurt and marshmallows in a large bowl. Gently fold in the strawberries and Mandarin oranges. Scoop into a serving bowl, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before serving. This is a simple, tasty, and colorful variation of a classic ambrosia salad. My son loves it; he keeps asking me when I'm going to make some more of that 'marshmallow casserole'!

Bake the cobbler in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the water and 1/2 cup sugar to a boil in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in the butter and vanilla extract, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes; set aside. Once the cobbler has baked 15 minutes, remove from the oven, and drizzle evenly with the vanilla syrup. Return to the oven, and continue baking until the syrup has evaporated from the cobbler topping, about 5 minutes more. A simple sugar syrup gives a golden sheen to this juicy berry cobbler that's a summer staple at our house.  Also great with just peaches or a mix of both. Best with vanilla ice cream!

Place on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. (At this point, can be frozen up to 2 weeks.) Brush tops with oil. Bake until golden, 16 to 20 minutes (longer if frozen). Go deep this Super Bowl Sunday: Serve empanadas. These turnovers are perfect 'finger food' -- no knife and fork required. And because the recipes use refrigerated biscuit dough, it's an easy score. All you have to do is make the fillings.
Mix together the cake mix, eggs, and vegetable oil. Drop by teaspoonful onto foil covered cookie sheet.  Cook at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)  for 7 to 8 minutes.  Do not overbake.  (Overbaking will cause your cookies to be hard as rocks!) Once your cookies are all done, lightly dust with confectioners'  sugar.  Place in container with the banana (leave the peel on), and cover with the foil from the baking sheet.  After a couple of hours, or overnight, the cookies will take on some of the banana flavor and taste great!  I discovered this by accident when I sent the strawberry cookies and a banana together for the dessert in my husband's lunch! Fun and Delicious!  Great for kids to help.
In a mixing bowl, combine the gelatin mix, cottage cheese, whipped topping and pineapple. Mix together well, refrigerate until chilled and serve. This is a favorite holiday treat for my family.  It can be made with sugar free  gelatin, fat free cottage cheese, and fat free cool whip for a lower calorie treat.  This is an EASY and quick treat!
Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion juice, garlic juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, cayenne pepper and beer. Mix until well blended. Use a marinade injecting syringe or turkey baster with an injector tip to inject the marinade all over the turkey including the legs, back, wings, thighs and breasts. Place in a large plastic bag and marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Do not use a kitchen trash bag. If your turkey is large, you can use an oven bag. When it's time to fry, measure the amount of oil needed by lowering the turkey into the fryer and filling with enough oil to cover it. Remove the turkey and set aside. Heat the oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). When the oil has come to temperature, lower the turkey into the hot oil slowly using the hanging device that comes with turkey deep-fryers. The turkey should be completely submerged in the oil. Cook for 36 minutes, or 3 minutes per pound of turkey. The turkey is done when the temperature in the thickest part of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Turn off the flame and slowly remove from the oil, making sure all of the oil drains out of the cavity. Allow to rest on a serving platter for about 20 minutes before carving. Delicious, juicy and tender, this recipe was given to me by a true Cajun sixteen years ago and has been on our Thanksgiving table ever since. The injector and instructions for frying came with our fryer which was a good thing because this original recipe didn't explain all the nuances of frying a turkey. It is well worth the learning process, though. We strain the peanut oil after it cools and pour it back into the containers (I bought it in gallon jugs). It will keep nicely in a cool place, under 40 degrees, or in the refrigerator until needed again.
In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and milk until blended. Mix in the sugar and  peanut butter until smooth, then fold in the whipped topping. Spoon mixture into all 3 graham cracker crusts. Drizzle each with chocolate syrup and a sprinkle of peanuts. Cover and freeze for about 2 to 3 hours. Let stand 30 minutes at room temperature before serving. Easy to make, sweet and yummy!! This a very creamy summertime recipe!! Top each pie slice with a dollop of whipped topping!
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, 1/2 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg, butter, and vanilla. Mix until well blended. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Heat oil in a deep heavy skillet or deep-fryer to 370 degrees F (185 degrees C). On a floured board, roll chilled dough out to 1/2 inch thickness. Use a 3 inch round cutter to cut out doughnuts. Use a smaller cutter to cut holes from center. If you do not have a small cutter, use the mouth of a bottle. Fry doughnuts in hot oil until golden brown, turning once. Remove from oil to drain on paper plates. Combine the remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 cup sugar in a large resealable bag. Place a few warm donuts into the bag at a time, seal and shake to coat. Lightly spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Preparation time is short and well worth the effort.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, and basil in the hot oil until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir snap peas into onion mixture and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Pour chicken stock, Marsala wine, and white wine into skillet. Add penne pasta; cook and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Divide pasta and snap pea mixture into 2 bowls and sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese to serve. I was craving some pasta the other night and thought that Marsala wine would compliment it great. This recipe is what I came up with on the spur of the moment with what I had lying around my poor, grad school student's kitchen.  I think it turned out delicious!
Combine oats, banana, cinnamon, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl; add water and stir. Cook in microwave until water is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir to evenly distribute cinnamon; let stand until slightly cooled, about 3 minutes. Spoon Greek yogurt, strawberry jam, and peanut butter over oatmeal; stir. Oatmeal is a great way to start a day! I have it almost every morning, so to not get bored I add different toppings and vary the ingredients I put in, always healthy and always delicious! Greek yogurt goes fantastically with hot oats and makes it creamier, adds protein, and most important of all makes a standard bowl of oatmeal phenomenal! Sprinkle with some more cinnamon, if you desire.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Coat a 10x15 inch lasagna pan with cooking spray. Place the spinach in a medium bowl.  Microwave, uncovered, on high for 4 minutes.  Mix in ricotta.

Spread about 1/2 cup pasta sauce mixture evenly in the bottom of the dish.  Place 3 uncooked noodles over the sauce.  Spread half of the spinach mixture over the noodles.  Sprinkle with half of the carrots and half of the mushrooms.  Place 3 more noodles over the vegetable mixture.  Pour 1 1/2 cups sauce over the noodles.  Spread the remaining spinach mixture over the sauce, followed by layers of the remaining carrots and mushrooms.  Place 3 more noodles over the vegetables.  Pour remaining sauce evenly on top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese.  Spray a sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray.  Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil, spray side down. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven, uncover, and spoon some sauce over the exposed top noodles. Turn the oven off, and place the uncovered dish back into the warm oven for 15 more minutes.  Serve at once, or let rest until ready to serve. Lasagna for the family who does not tolerate cooked tomatoes. The uncooked lasagna noodles make this recipe easy and fast.  For non-vegetarians try adding a pound of sauteed hot Italian sausage.  Simply delicious!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter one 3 quart casserole dish. In a large bowl combine the corn bread, stuffing mix, parsley, salt and ginger. In a heavy saucepan melt the butter and saute; the celery and onion for 8 to 10 minutes or until tender. Add this to the cornbread mixture and mix well. Stir in the chopped apple, chopped pecans, apple juice and beaten eggs. Toss lightly. Spoon dressing into the prepared casserole dish. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Savory, yet sweet this cornbread dressing will satisfy anyone's appetite. 2 teaspoons dried parsley can be substituted for fresh. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.
In a medium bowl, blend the cream cheese and sour cream. Mix in the celery, green onions, lemon juice, Cheddar cheese, imitation crab and hot pepper sauce. Serve chilled.

Adjust the amounts of imitation crab and hot pepper sauce to taste.
Stir mayonnaise, sour cream, buttermilk, lemon juice, sherry, and garlic salt together in a bowl. Fold blue cheese through the mixture. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 2 hours. This is my husband's favorite dressing. Besides salads, he likes to use it as a dip for eating artichokes. It is easy to make and tasty.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray 9x13 glass baking dish with cooking spray. Spread hamburger into bottom of pan, covering entire bottom, gently tamping beef down.

Layer tater tots on top, covering entire top with tots.  Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees) for 1 hour, or until hamburger is done. Check after 30 minutes; if tots are getting too brown, turn down to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Such an easy recipe, but so tasty! Moist inside and crispy on top! A complete meal in one pan.
Bring water to a boil in a saucepan; add lentils. Cover and simmer until lentils are tender, about 35 minutes. Drain and and cool to room temperature. Divide lentils among 4 salad plates; layer with mozzarella cheese slices, prosciutto, and fresh basil. Drizzle balsamic vinaigrette over each salad. This salad functions as a perfect lunch or side dish for dinner. The Italian flavors mix beautifully in your mouth.
In a saucepan, combine the carbonated beverage and marshmallows. Stir over medium heat until marshmallows melt. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

In a large saucepan, mix the cucumber mixture, turmeric, celery seed and white sugar.  Pour in the vinegar, adjusting the amount so that it covers the mixture. Bring to a boil. Transfer to sterile jars. Store in the refrigerator. Tasty pickles that take some time, but are easy to make. One crunch and you'll agree they are worth the wait!
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, then add green onions and mushrooms; cook and stir until tender, about 5 minutes. Season haddock with salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried chile pepper and place in the baking dish. Top with green onion and mushroom mixture, then dot with butter. Sprinkle parsley on top. Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove foil and top haddock with cheese and return baking dish to the oven. Continue baking until the fish flakes easily with a fork and the cheese is melted, 15 to 20 minutes. This recipe is quick and very tasty. It's also very adaptable - you can do just about anything with it.
Place the mushrooms, eggplant, winter squash, and zucchini into a shallow bowl or baking dish. Drizzle with the balsamic vinaigrette, turning to coat evenly. Cover, and refrigerate at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours, stirring occasionally. Preheat grill to medium-high heat. Drain vegetables and discard marinade. Place vegetables on preheated grill, and cook until lightly browned, turning once, or about 3 minutes on each side. (Note that cooking times vary between grills.) Sprinkle the mushrooms with blue cheese, and let the cheese melt slightly. Open the 6 hamburger buns and divide the eggplant, squash, and zucchini among bottom halves. Place the portobello mushrooms on top of the vegetables, cheese side up. Top with the remaining 6 hamburger bun halves. If necessary, use toothpicks to hold the buns in place. Serve immediately. Portobello mushrooms, winter squash, and eggplant are marinated, then grilled and topped with blue cheese in what's become a favorite at my house.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, whip egg whites with an electric mixer until foamy.

Mix in the milk, egg yolks, and lemon juice until well blended, then fold in the egg whites using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Melt the butter in a large cast-iron (or other oven proof) skillet over medium heat. Spread the batter evenly in the pan. Layer the thinly sliced apple over the batter, and sprinkle with cinnamon and remaining sugar. Place the skillet in the oven, and bake for 10 minutes, or until the apples are golden brown and glazed looking. Cut into wedges to serve. A delicious baked omelet using fresh apples! I double the apple for more flavor.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wash the turkey well, and pat dry with paper towels. Use your hands to slather the whole turkey, front and back, with butter. Make sure to butter the wing tips and leg ends. Place the turkey into a roasting pan, and pour the cola over the turkey. Sprinkle the whole turkey with salt and black pepper. Roast the turkey for 4 to 5 hours, checking for doneness after 4 hours. Baste the turkey every 30 minutes with the turkey drippings. If the breast skin browns too quickly, cover it with aluminum foil. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area  10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Want a delicious, tender, juicy and BEAUTIFUL turkey?  Try what my Grandpa taught me when I was just a little girl.  I've ALWAYS made my turkey this way and it always turns out great.  And besides, you get LOTS of wide eyed looks!  The idea behind the cola is that the acid in the soda helps to tenderize the bird, the sugar and caramel gives it just a hint of sweetness, and the coloring helps to give the bird a beautiful roasted color.  Enjoy!!

When ready to grill, add soaked wood chips to the coals or to the smoker box of a gas grill. Lightly oil grill grate. Place ribs on the grill two racks at a time so they are not crowded. Cook for 20 minutes, turning occasionally. Baste ribs with sauce during the last 10 minutes of grilling, so the sauce does not burn. This is a multiple prize-winning master recipe. It has several steps that can be used on pork spareribs, country-style ribs, or pretty much any other type of pork rib; simply adjust oven time up for meatier cuts. Use some soaked wood chips on the barbecue. The smokier the grill, the better the ribs will taste!

Beat the egg in a measuring cup.  Add the vinegar and enough cold water to make one cup of liquid. In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and brown sugar.  Cut the lard up into small cubes, and add to the dry ingredients.  Blend with two knives, or a pastry blender, until the mixture is crumbly.  Add the liquid ingredients, mixing with a knife.  Do not use your hands as it tends to soften the lard too much.  Add additional water, if required, to make a soft ball of dough.  If the weather is warm, refrigerate your dough for 1/2 hour to chill it before rolling.  Warm dough doesn't roll as well, and requires too much flour, which makes it less flaky. This pie crust has been passed on for 3 generations.  If you're looking for great tasting pastry, this is the recipe for you. While the debate between shortening and lard continues, I recommend using lard as it makes a flakier dough. Since this recipe makes so much I often roll out some extra pie shells or freeze it in small amounts, and defrost it when I need it.  Great when you're in a rush! If necessary, use up to a 1/2 cup more water.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 muffin cups with paper liners. Mix cake mix and cherry-flavored cola together in a bowl until batter is smooth.

Place beef patties on the grill, and set the onions on top of them. Grill for about 5 minutes on each side, or to desired doneness. If you're lucky (or trashy) enough to still have a coffee can of grease on your stove, brush both sides of the Hawaiian rolls, then toast them on the grill. To assemble, place the patties on buns, and top with slices of American and Edam cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and your choice of condiments such as ketchup, Creole mustard, and salad dressing.

Combine black pepper, paprika, coriander, dry mustard, white pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Set aside. Cover a baking sheet with a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Coat aluminum foil with prepared garlic oil. Lay corned beef brisket on foil and brush with remaining garlic oil. Cover all sides of corned beef brisket completely with pepper mixture, reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons. With fat side of corned beef brisket up, wrap in the sheet of aluminum foil. Place wrapped corned beef on another sheet of aluminum foil with the seam and fat side down. Place double-wrapped corned beef on a third sheet of aluminum foil (seam down), and wrap again. Bake in the preheated oven for 6 hours. Remove pastrami from the oven and let cool to room temperature, about 3 hours. With pastrami still wrapped in aluminum foil, place in a freezer bag or other plastic bag and refrigerate for 8 to 10 hours.

Remove pastrami from refrigerator, unwrap, and place on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle top with 1 to 2 tablespoons of remaining pepper mixture. Place pastrami in the oven, 6 to 8 inches below broiler heat. Broil briefly to brown surface, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove pastrami from the oven and slice thinly, about 1/8-inch slices. Heat a large skillet over low heat. Heat pastrami slices in the skillet with a few drops of water until fat begins to turn from white to translucent, about 5 minutes. Great pastrami is not the easiest thing to find west of the Catskills, so a few years ago I embarked on a mission to find a way to turn the common corned beef into something similar. My goal was to come up with a reasonable substitute that could be done in less than a day at home, without a smoker, or any other special equipment. Impossible? No!

Thread the lamb and onions onto the skewers, using 3 onions per skewer. Cook the skewers on the preheated grill until the lamb has cooked to your desired degree of doneness, about 8 minutes for medium-well. Meanwhile, bring the reserved marinade to a simmer over medium heat. Whisk in the apricot preserves until dissolved, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer gently for 5 minutes, adding water if needed to keep the sauce from burning. Dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water, and whisk into the sauce to thicken; simmer the sauce 30 seconds longer. Serve with the lamb skewers. A minted honey and lemon sauce provides a great tasting variation on these lamb skewers.

Want a roasted chicken that is juicy inside without the use of a baking bag or flour? Then this recipe is perfect. It is quick and easy to prepare. The picture shown does display a chicken that was cooked in a bag, but the chicken was also roasted with vegetables and needed the bag to immerse the vegetables in the chicken flavor. I still guarantee a juicy chicken without the use of a bag each and every time.

Place stuffed chicken in prepared baking dishes. Brush each chicken breast with about 1 teaspoon infused olive oil and sprinkle Parmesan cheese over the top. Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cool slightly before serving, about 5 minutes. Skinless, boneless chicken breasts are split and stuffed with mushrooms, ricotta, and feta cheeses and marinated artichokes and sprinkled with Italian seasonings and Parmesan! To add Italian flair, serve the chicken over pasta with your favorite sauce. Make sure the mushrooms are sliced thin, and don't rinse the artichoke hearts, just drain them. You can substitute goat cheese for the feta cheese.

Place onion quarters in the chicken cavity. Rub remaining paste all over chicken. Place chicken on a rack set inside a roasting pan. Roast in the preheated oven until skin is browned, the juices run clear, and an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into a chicken thigh, not touching bone, reads at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 2 hours. This is a very simple change for a roast chicken dinner. You can even add the vegetables (carrots, potatoes, etc.) and the whole meal is ready. Please note the flavor will change with the type of curry paste you use.
In a shallow dish or bowl, season flour with salt and pepper to taste. Dredge chicken in seasoned flour to coat. In a large skillet, brown coated chicken in melted butter or margarine until golden.

Reduce heat to low and let simmer, covered, for 1 hour. Stir in sour cream and heat through, but DO NOT BOIL! Top with chopped green onion and serve over noodles or rice, if desired. I wanted something like the traditional beef stroganoff and threw this one together, writing down everything as I went so I wouldn't forget.  I served with noodles, but rice would be great, too. Asparagus for a vegetable and a green or fruit salad is great!  Nutmeg seems to be the secret ingredient of many Stroganoff recipes.
Divide the lettuce between two bowls. Halve and core the pear, then cut each half in slices. Divide the pear slices and pomegranate seeds among the two bowls and mix gently.

In a small bowl, stir together mint leaves and cider vinegar. Let stand for 10 minutes before using to blend flavors. I grew up with this in the UK, and this is how everyone made it. I would be surprised if any pub had additional ingredients. Mint has a sweetness of its own, but a little sugar would be okay, if the diner had a desire for extra sweetness - no more that 1/2 teaspoon. Cider or malt vinegar can be used for the vinegar if you prefer. This sauce is traditionally served with lamb.

Adjust oven rack to low position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Open puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured work surface. Roll into a rectangle, about 10 by 16 inches. Transfer to a large cookie sheet. (I suggest lining the sheet with parchment paper; this ensures the crostada doesn't stick and allows easy cleanup.) Spread cooked apples over pastry, leaving a 2-inch border. Fold up pastry borders over apples. Unfold corners and form ruffled creases to keep dough from overlapping. Brush pastry border with egg white and sprinkle with the remaining 1 Tb. sugar. Bake until pastry is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature with optional ice cream or whipped cream. While a good pie crust ought to be a part of every cook's repertoire, sometimes there just isn't the time. But why leave the baking to the grocery stores or bakery when puff pastry is a simple, high-quality stand-in for the original? In this Crostada, the sheet dough is baked free-form with ingredients piled on top. Couldn't be easier!

Mix Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, chicken soup base, roasted garlic, and butter in a bowl. Add cauliflower to the cheese mixture; beat with an electric hand mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Beat milk into the mixture until you get your desired texture. Season with salt and pepper. Finally mastered this dish after about a dozen tries! Great low-carb side dish to replace mashed potatoes. Like I said above, I have made this at least a dozen times and feel I have perfected it! Fool around with it some, but I have found these ingredients, cutting as much stem off, and squeezing all the water out really make this delicious! You can add a splash of milk to make it even creamier.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Cook and stir almonds and sugar in a skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar melts and almonds turn golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer almonds to the prepared baking sheet to cool completely. This simple topping turns an average salad into something above and beyond! I pair these with my sweet sour salad dressing and they make an amazing salad!  I like to make up a big batch of these and keep them on-hand in an airtight container to use as a salad topper. I like to toast my almonds to a nice medium-brown, they take on a bolder flavor and really mix well in any salad.

Good for a chilly day when a bowl of warm soup is just what you need, or when you want to use up your fresh summer veggies. Goes well with a loaf of crusty Italian bread. You can put pretty much any vegetable combination in this soup. I have used chopped fresh okra; it's good for a nice pop in your mouth. You can also use pearled barley in place of the oro pasta. Just add it to the soup when you put in the veggies, and an extra cup of water. I like that it makes a big pot, because it's even better as leftovers.

Shape the dough into a ball, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Cut the dough in half and place half in the refrigerator to stay cold. Roll the other half between 2 pieces of wax paper or parchment into a sheet about 1/8 inch thick. Lift off the top sheet, and use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut 18 cookies. Before lifting the cutouts from the wax paper, put the dough onto a flat baking sheet and into the freezer for a few minutes to firm up the cookies. Set the 18 cookies aside. Repeat with the other half of the dough, also making 18 heart-shaped cookies. Place 18 cookies onto the prepared baking sheets so they don't touch. Carefully brush a little beaten egg around the top of each cookie, and spoon about 1 teaspoon of preserves into the center of the cookie. Top each with another unfilled cookie, press together around the edges, and crimp the edges with a fork to seal in the filling and make a pretty edge. Brush the tops of the filled cookies with beaten egg, and sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are a light golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely before placing in containers. These EASY cookies are flaky, tender, and just delicious, whether glazed or sprinkled with sugar. If you roll it out in half batches and keep the dough cold, you will be rewarded with what has turned out to be one of my family's favorite cookies! Sprinkle with regular or coarse pastry sugar.

Steam over the boiling water until the cake is cooked through, about 25 minutes. Allow the cake to cool before cutting into squares to serve. This is a slightly different take on the traditional Thai steamed pumpkin cake. You simply need to grate the pumpkin, mix all the ingredients together, place in a pan, and steam. You can cool the cake and cut it into squares to serve at a later time - it is the perfect snack!
Mix together the garlic, chipotle peppers, lemon juice, olive oil, paprika, cilantro, kosher salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and cayenne pepper in a bowl.

Remove from heat and transfer to a mixing bowl to cool. Stir in the almond extract; cover the surface with plastic wrap and refrigerate until you're ready to fill the eclairs. For the glaze, combine the chocolate, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 2 tablespoons of water in a saucepan. Heat gently until the mixture has melted. Remove from the heat and stir in 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar. If the icing is too thick, add a little more water. For creamier glaze, substitute milk for 2 tablespoons of water. Cut the tops off of the cooled shells and fill them with the custard. Replace tops, and glaze them with the chocolate icing. These are just the best! I don't know how the eclair shells form the pocket, but they do every time. The custard is incredible, I suggest trying it in other things as well.

Cool cakes for 5 minutes, then turn one layer out onto a plate scraping off any pineapple that may be stuck. Next, invert second cake layer onto the first so there is pineapple in the middle and on top of the cake.  May be served warm with whipped cream, if desired. I could not find a good upside down pineapple cake so I made this up. This cake is so moist it needs no icing.  It's great, especially for breakfast!

The assortment of nuts makes it deluxe Caramel Corn. It takes a bit of time, but is more than worth it.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk brown sugar, white sugar, 1/4 cup oats, 1 teaspoon flour, and a pinch of cinnamon together in a bowl. Add rhubarb and blueberries; stir to coat. Pour mixture into a small baking dish. Stir 1/2 cup flour, 1/3 cup oats, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl; add enough butter to create a crumbly topping, about 1/2 of the butter. Sprinkle crumbly topping over rhubarb mixture, and drizzle remaining butter over the top. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving. I created this dessert because I still had tons of rhubarb hanging around in my freezer and I was sick of the go-to strawberry/rhubarb combination. It turned out amazingly! The tart taste of rhubarb is, not surprisingly, complemented by blueberry. Delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
Mix brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir vinegar, water, honey, and mustard together in a saucepan; add brown sugar mixture and whisk until blended.

Allow the mixture to sit for 10 minutes. Slice the bread. On a baking sheet, arrange the slices in a single layer. Brown both sides of the bread slightly in the oven. Remove the slices from the oven. Spread the tomato mixture on the slices. Broil 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture is hot but not cooked. A great summer appetizer featuring fresh tomato salsa on toasted Italian bread.
Mix ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, and onion soup mix together in a bowl; shape into 6 oblong patties. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patties until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Stir golden mushroom soup and water together in a bowl; pour over the patties in the skillet. Turn patties to coat in the liquid. Bring liquid to a simmer, reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook until steaks are very firm, hot, and grey in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). These are delicious steaks my mom used to make when I was growing up. They are easy too! They go great with mashed potatoes or white rice and have a flavorful sauce left over, almost like a gravy.
Toast the cumin seeds in a medium saute pan over medium-low heat for 5 minutes, or until fragrant. In a blender, combine the cumin seeds, jalapenos, garlic, pepper, lime juice, and salt.  Pulse the blender to finely chop ingredients.  Add the oil and cilantro and puree until smooth. Lightly score both sides of the meat with a knife so that the marinade will penetrate.  Place the meat in a large plastic bag or bowl, pour in the marinade, and coat well.  Marinate in the refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Remove the meat from the marinade and discard the remaining marinade. Cook on high, 1 to 2 minutes per side, to sear the meat.  Turn the heat down to low and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until the it has reached the desired doneness. This is a great way to serve skirt or flank steak. The two day marinade is worth the wait.

Stir braising liquid and shredded beef into tomato mixture; simmer to blend flavors, about 1 more hour. Season with hot sauce, salt, and black pepper. This is the chili I make for Super Bowl (and many other occasions). I developed the recipe over about a five year period, and it is a huge hit with my friends. The 'secret' ingredients include Thai fish sauce, lime, and whiskey. This recipe takes a long time with multiple steps. You can braise and shred the beef and make the sauce on separate days, and it's definitely better the next day. Garnish with sweet onion, Cheddar cheese, sour cream, and salsa. Serve over rice, beans, or pasta.

I invented this recipe with ingredients I managed to scrounge on a winter's night several years ago. It has become a cold weather staple. I always serve it with bread and plenty of hot sauce. My cat, Bela, goes nuts when I make this!

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the salmon from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Grill the salmon on the preheated grill until browned and the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes on each side. An easy delicious way to grill salmon. This also reheats nicely for lunches the next day!

Combine mirin, miso paste, egg yolk, and sake in a saucepan and mix well; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring constantly, until sauce is the consistency of jam, 10 to 15 minutes. My host-mother in Japan introduced me to this sweet sauce flavored with miso and mirin. Miso sauce can stay in the fridge for a pretty long time, so you can make a lot of it at once. Grilled tofu, fried eggplant, or pan-seared fish complement it well.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease 2 9x5-inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, mix together the ground lamb, chicken, and pork until the 3 meats are thoroughly combined; mix in the egg, rolled oats, onion, green pepper, raisins, carrots, ketchup, hot pepper sauce, garlic, curry powder, oregano, and rosemary.

In a double boiler, combine milk, water, salt and chocolate. Heat, stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat and allow to cool. Add vanilla. Spread or drizzle over your cake. The yummiest chocolate icing ever. Because of its gooey nature, this icing is not meant for layer cakes, but sheet cakes only. Easy, too!
Mix paprika, ancho chile powder, black pepper, and allspice together in a spice shaker or bowl. Place pork chops on a plate and coat both sides of chops with spice mixture. Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture onto the plate and pat the outsides of each chop into the spice mixture until entire chop is coated. Put coated pork chops in a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for flavors to absorb into the pork chops, 4 to 12 hours. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place pork chops in the hot oil and reduce heat to medium; season with salt. Cook pork chops until partially blackened, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap edges together creating a seal. Allow pork chops to "cook" from the residual heat inside the foil wrap, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Place pork chops on a serving plate and spoon residual juices in the foil over each chop. This chile-rubbed pork chop video recipe is a kinder, gentler version of the 'blackened' cooking technique. We start on high heat, but cook the chops on medium, and then finish the cooking by wrapping the chops in foil. This produces a very moist chop, as the meat has time to 'rest' as it finishes cooking.

Mix ground beef, onion, green bell pepper, parsley, salt, paprika, garlic, black pepper, and thyme together in a bowl; divide into 4 portions and shape into patties. Arrange patties on the prepared baking sheet. Dust both sides of patties with flour and brush with oil. Broil in the preheated oven until steaks are cooked through, 4 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). These Salisbury steaks are flavorful and very moist. Nothing like the shoe leather served in cafeterias and frozen dinners. These steaks go wonderful served with a Belmont sauce.

Remove the chicken rolls from the oven, and place an oven rack about 6 inches from the oven's broiler heat source. Turn on the broiler, and broil the rolls until the bacon is brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. This is my Mushroom Melt Stuffed Chicken.

Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Cool to room temperature. Combine cream cheese and confectioner 's sugar in medium bowl. Beat with electric mixer at medium speed until smooth. Beat in vanilla and almond extracts. Fold in whipped cream and almonds by hand until well mixed. Pour into cooled crust. Refrigerate until firm. Decorate pie with strawberries fully or just around the edge. Heat jelly in microwave oven just until soft and brush carefully over strawberries until glazed. Refrigerate until serving. This is the 1999 American Pie Council 's National Pie Championship's first place winner in the Cream Pie Category.
Combine the pig's feet, vinegar, water, soy sauce, onion, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves, sugar, and salt together in a stockpot; bring to a boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; allow the stew to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the meat pulls easily from the bones and the liquid has thickened, about 1 hour. Serve hot. This pork dish is easy to prepare and is great for a busy homemaker. Serve hot over rice.
Bring water and bouillon cube to a boil in a pot until bouillon is dissolved; decrease heat to low. Whisk tahini, soy sauce, honey, garlic, and ginger into bouillon mixture until smooth. Keep sauce warm over low heat. Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk flour into tahini sauce until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cooked chicken to tahini sauce and toss to coat. The key ingredient, tahini, is a sesame paste available in Asian stores, but recently has been seen in major grocery chains. It tastes like a mix of Asian and Mediterranean, close to a peanut sauce satay but made from sesame. It's quick, tasty, and out of the ordinary. Serve over couscous or noodles.
Combine rice and water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover with lid, and allow to steam until tender, about 20 minutes. While rice is cooking, grind peanuts in a blender and set aside. Heat the margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned golden brown about 10 minutes. Stir in ginger, carrots, and salt to taste. Reduce heat to low and cover to steam 5 minutes. Stir in cayenne pepper and peanuts. When rice is done, add it to skillet and stir gently to combine with other ingredients. Garnish with chopped cilantro. Fragrant basmati rice sauteed with carrots, onions, fresh ginger, peanuts, and cilantro. You will be surprised to taste this delicious rice.
Finely chop mushrooms in a food processor or blender; transfer to a bowl. Mix walnuts, mayonnaise, garlic, tahini, salt, and pepper with the mushrooms until evenly combined. Serve dip alongside pita bread. This is not a dip for your mushrooms. It is a dip made from mushrooms. It's delicious! Serve with pita bread.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Melt 1/4 cup butter or margarine in an 8-inch square pan. Sprinkle with brown sugar and nutmeg. Arrange peach halves, cut side down, in pan. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg. Stir together flour, baking powder and salt. Add flour mixture to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating well after each addition. Spread batter over peaches. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned on top, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove cake from oven, and let stand in pan for 5 minutes; invert onto serving platter. This cake uses fresh peaches. Serve with whipped cream.
Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic and thyme. Cook, stirring constantly, until onion is tender. Stir in the beef broth, scraping any onion bits from the bottom of the pan, then stir in the port wine. Bring to a boil, and cook until the mixture has reduced to about 1/2 cup. Set aside. This may also be made ahead of time, and reheated. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat oil in a cast-iron or other oven-safe skillet over high heat. Sear steaks quickly on both sides until brown, then place the whole pan into the oven. Roast steaks in the oven for about 15 minutes for medium rare - with an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). You may adjust this time to allow the steaks to finish just below your desired degree of doneness if medium is not what you prefer.  Remove from the oven, and place on a baking sheet. Stir together the panko crumbs and blue cheese. Top each steak with a layer of this mixture. Preheat the oven's broiler. Place steaks under the preheated broiler until the cheese topping is browned and bubbly. 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oven, and let stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve with warm port wine sauce. Worth the effort! Tender and flavorful, great for a dinner party. Make the sauce a day ahead to cut down on the prep time.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans. In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, 1 egg and orange zest; beat until smooth. Set aside. Sift together 1 2/3 cup flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cloves and pumpkin pie spice; set aside Place pumpkin, vegetable oil, 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cup sugar in a large bowl; beat well. Stir the pumpkin mixture into the flour mixture just until combined. Fold in the pecans if desired. Pour 1/2 of the pumpkin batter into the loaf pans. Spoon cream cheese mixture on top of this layer and then pour on the remaining batter. Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool bread in pans for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. This is the best pumpkin bread you'll ever eat. I have been making this recipe for years and I always get asked for the recipe. It has a yummy cream cheese filling  in the middle of the loaf.
Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Cut shortening into flour mixture until mixture resembles corn meal. Stir in hot water, 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time, until mixture forms into a ball. Knead dough until evenly combined. Cut dough into 8 pieces; roll each piece into a ball. Press each ball into a flat tortilla-shape. Heat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Cook each tortilla in the hot griddle until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side. My sons really miss flour tortillas since we have gone gluten-free. So I have tinkered with a bunch of wheat flour tortilla recipes to create one that fits our new diet. These aren't your traditional thin tortillas (basically because I press them by hand) but a nice thick and more chewy-style that reminds me of flat bread.
Whisk ketchup, chicken broth, egg, soy sauce, chile-garlic sauce, oyster sauce, tamarind paste, fish sauce, and palm sugar together in a bowl. Stir shallots, garlic, oil, ginger, and serrano pepper together in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute until sizzling, about 2 minutes. Add crab to pot, cover the pot with a lid, and shake until crab is completely coated in shallot mixture. Remove lid and cook and stir until heated through, about 3 minutes. Pour ketchup mixture into pot, reduce heat to medium, and cook and stir until sauce thickens and crab is hot about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in cilantro and green onions. Living in San Francisco, I've had more than my fair share of crab, prepared in more ways than I can remember. I've never enjoyed it more than in this Singapore-style chili crabs recipe. Just be sure to have lots of napkins around. My friends in Singapore tell me they serve this with at least twice the amount of sauce, and a type of fried roll to soak up the goodness with. So, if you want to rock the chili crab like a Singaporean, then you should probably double the sauce ingredients!
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Cook and stir zucchini, onion, and garlic in hot oil until moisture comes from the zucchini, about 10 minutes. Pour chicken stock and milk into the pot; bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir ground sage, salt, and pepper into the stock mixture; cook at a simmer for 20 minutes. Add Brie cheese; cook and stir until melted completely into the liquid, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour soup into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Pour blended soup through a strainer into a clean pot. Puree in batches until smooth. Stir cream into the blended soup and place pot over medium-low heat; cook until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Garnish individual servings with fresh sage leaves. A soft textured soup with mild flavor. Great for winter nights or serve cool in the summer.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter or spray one 2 quart casserole dish. Prepare stuffing according to directions on box; place stuffing in a large bowl. Add the dried bread, eggs and water; mix well and place in casserole dish. Cover and bake 45 to 60 minutes. I continue to use this easy recipe because my family kept insisting how good my stuffing was, however I always felt guilty for using the stuffing mix.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange tater tots in the prepared baking dish. In a mixing bowl, combine sour cream, cheese, and mushroom soup. Pour this mixture over the tater tots. Sprinkle onions over the top of the casserole. Bake in the 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 45 to 60 minutes. This is a recipe everyone in the family will love.  Vegetarian or not, the combination of tater tots, cheese, and mushroom soup will drive your taste buds crazy!
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, and cook stirring constantly for a few minutes. Remove from heat, and gradually whisk in the chicken broth so that no lumps form. Return to medium heat, and bring to a simmer. Add watercress, cover, and cook over low heat for 20 minutes. Puree in small batches using a blender, or blend in the pan using an immersion blender. Return to the saucepan, and stir in the half-and-half cream. Heat until warm, but do not boil. Watercress is a very fresh flavor, as well as being very nutritious. This soup is a great way to enjoy both!
Preheat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Peel the plantains and cut them in half. Slice the halves lengthwise into thin pieces. Fry the pieces until browned and tender. Drain excess oil on paper towels. Fried plantains are a traditional treat in many parts of the world. Try them once and you'll be hooked. Overly ripe plantains work best for this recipe.
Whisk milk, sugar, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract together in a large bowl. Add snow to milk mixture, about 1 cup at a time, until ice cream is thickened. Freeze for 2 hours. A wonderful, rare Christmas treat! Make sure snow has fallen for 2 hours, as it takes that to clean air pollutants.  Then take a clean blanket, and collect the snow. Enjoy!
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Stir the salt, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, coriander, and turmeric together in a small bowl; set aside. Rub the steaks on all sides with the seasoning mixture. Cook on the preheated grill to your desired degree of doneness, 3 to 3 1/2 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). This seasoning makes any steak awesome. This is the best. It doesn't overpower the steak. I can't eat a steak out anymore because I always compare it to this seasoning.
Heat olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium heat. Stir in red bell pepper and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until golden. Dissolve tomato paste in 1 cup water and pour it into the pressure cooker. Place chicken thighs and drumsticks in the pan so the pieces are evenly spaced. Add enough water so that the chicken is nearly covered. Seal the pressure cooker and bring up to pressure over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, maintaining full pressure; cook for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow the pressure to drop naturally, about 20 minutes. Season chicken with salt to taste. My husband's family came from Cuba 25 years ago, and this is his favorite meal. Serve with frijoles negros and arros blanco (black beans and rice).
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place the brown sugar, ketchup, mayonnaise, yellow mustard, Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, and cayenne pepper into a bowl, and stir until blended. Place the pork chops on the preheated grill, and cook the chops until the surface is seared but the meat is just barely pink in the middle, about 5 minutes. Brush the chops with the glaze mixture, and flip to cook the glaze onto the meat. When the glazed side shows good grill marks, flip again, brush glaze onto the pork chops, flip, and grill until the other side shows nice brown grill marks. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). We've had this recipe around for some time, but just recently updated it with some new ingredients. This is also good on pork steaks and chicken.
Combine vinegar, water, 2 tablespoons sugar, fish sauce, and red pepper flakes in a glass, ceramic, or stainless steel bowl; stir until sugar is dissolved. Add carrots and daikon radish. Put a plate on top to weigh down vegetables and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Combine soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sugar, and garlic in a shallow baking dish; stir until sugar is dissolved. Add steak, pressing down until steak is covered in marinade, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Heat a ridged grill pan over high heat; add oil. Remove steak from marinade and discard marinade. Grill steak until desired doneness is reached, 6 to 10 minutes per side. Transfer steak to a cutting board and cool. Slice across grain into 24 thin slices. Drain carrot and daikon radishes, reserving 1/2 cup pickling liquid. Fill a shallow bowl with warm water. Dip 1 rice paper sheet into water to soften, about 5 seconds. Transfer sheet to a work surface. Arrange 2 pieces of lettuce over the half of wrapper closest to you. Top each lettuce leaf half with 2 slices of steak. Add about 1/4 cup carrot and daikon pickles and a few cilantro sprigs. Starting with bottom edge, begin to roll up rice paper sheet tightly around filling. After 1 roll, fold in ends of rice paper like a burrito, then finish rolling. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling. Diagonally cut rolls in half crosswise and arrange on a serving platter. Whisk peanut butter, reserved pickling liquid, and sriracha hot sauce together in a bowl; serve on the side with rolls. It's worth seeking out flat-iron steak for this. Butchers used to set it aside for their own enjoyment, but it's now gained popularity with smart home cooks, too. Like most chuck steaks, it's full of flavor and reasonably priced.
Cook and stir ground beef in a large skillet over medium-high heat until the beef is crumbly and completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir water, tomato sauce, tomato paste, green chilies, instant rice, sugar, chili powder, garlic, oregano, cumin, and salt together with the cooked ground beef. Reduce heat to low, place a cover on the skillet, and cook mixture at a simmer until the flavors have blended and the beef is very tender, about 40 minutes. I serve this as a build-your-own taco salad meal. Start with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, shredded cheddar, and crushed tostada chips. Top off with the piping hot meat mixture, kinda toss together, and enjoy!
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Add the asparagus during the last 3 to 5 minutes of cooking. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine butter and half-and-half. Cook until thick and bubbly. Season with garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir in Parmesan cheese and chicken, and heat through. Pour sauce over pasta and asparagus, and toss to coat. This is so rich and filling that one serving goes a long way. Crusty bread and a salad is all this creamy dish needs to make a complete and hearty meal.
Stir together avocados, tomatoes, green onions, black beans, and Mexicorn. Stir in red wine vinegar, canola oil, and hot pepper sauce. Cover, and chill 1 hour. A colorful, light, and delicious concoction to serve with tortilla chips or pita bread. Avocados, tomatoes, green onions, black beans, and Mexicorn are combined with red wine vinegar, canola oil, and hot pepper sauce. Always a crowd pleaser! Serve with tortilla chips or pita bread.
In a large pitcher, stir together the Bloody Mary mix, horseradish, dill, hot pepper sauce, and dill pickle juice. Taste and adjust seasoning if desired. In a shallow dish, stir together the kosher salt, pepper and celery seed. Pour the lime juice onto a saucer. Dip each glass into the lime juice to coat the rim, then into the spice mixture. Fill each glass with ice. Pour one shot of vodka into each glass if using. Fill with the Bloody Mary mixture. Garnish each glass with a wedge of lime and a dill pickle spear. Bloody Marys are perfect for that Sunday morning brunch. This can also be served as a virgin bloody Mary (minus the vodka).
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place the potatoes in the oven, directly on the rack. Bake for 30 minutes. Poke a couple holes in the top of the potatoes with a fork and return them to the oven for another 15 minutes. While the potatoes are baking, prepare the chimichurri sauce: Finely mince the parsley, oregano, green onions and garlic. (If you want to save time, place ingredients in a food processor and pulse until finely minced.) Add the herbs to a 2-cup bowl. Then add the red pepper flakes, olive oil, vinegar and lemon juice. Season to taste with kosher salt. Set aside. Slice the top third of each potato off and let the potatoes cool until you can handle them comfortably. Scoop the flesh of the potatoes into a medium mixing bowl. Add 1 cup of the chimichurri sauce to the potatoes. Using a hand mixer, whip the potatoes until creamy and fluffy. Spoon the chimichurri potato mixture back into the potatoes. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake them at 400 degrees F for another 10 minutes. Serve them hot with an extra spoonful of the remaining chimichurri sauce. These Chimichurri Twice-Baked Potatoes are courtesy of Heather Christo as part of the U.S. Potato Board's Potato Lovers Club. Fresh parsley, oregano, garlic and olive oil make up this Argentinean-inspired sauce that is whipped into baked potatoes.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken and season with cumin, Mexican seasoning and cayenne pepper. Stir in the onion and garlic and cook until chicken is browned, about 5 minutes. Add red, yellow and orange peppers; cook and stir for another 5 minutes, then mix in the black beans, kidney beans and corn. Remove from the heat. Line the bottom and sides of a 9x13 inch baking dish with corn tortillas. Pour in the skillet mixture then top with cilantro and pepperjack cheese. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cheese is starting to brown on top. Let stand for 10 minutes, then serve with your favorite Mexican food toppings. My good friend brought this to me in the hospital after I had just had a baby. My husband promptly took it home and ate the entire thing without sharing. I had to remake it myself to find out what he'd been raving about. I've made a few adjustments and so can you according to your tastes! This is a great casserole to make because some of the canned ingredients you may already have. Serve with sour cream, hot sauce, and cold diced tomatoes or salsa if you like. Maybe even serve some chips and guacamole to round it out.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 12 cupcake cups with paper liners. In a bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder. In a mixing bowl, beat the white sugar with 1/2 cup butter until thoroughly mixed, then beat in the eggs, one at a time, incorporating each egg before adding the next. Stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Stir the flour mixture into the egg mixture, followed by the milk, mixing to make a smooth batter. Fill each lined cupcake cup about 2/3 full of batter, and push a frozen solid chocolate egg into the batter in the center of each cupcake so a tiny bit of the egg sticks out. Bake cupcakes in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned and the cakes spring back when pushed with a finger, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cupcakes to cool completely. In a bowl, beat 1/2 cup of butter with confectioners' sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract; add 1 tablespoon of milk, a teaspoon at a time, until the frosting is smooth. Beat in your choice of food color to desired shade, and spread frosting on each cupcake. Top each cupcake with a candy-coated mini egg for decoration. White cupcakes with a chocolate egg in the center, thick, colorful icing, and topped with a chocolate mini egg!!! Great Easter treat!!
Insert a wooden craft stick into the bottom of each apple.  Butter a baking sheet and set aside. Combine sugar, corn syrup and water in a heavy saucepan over medium heat.  Heat, without stirring, to 270 to 290 degrees F (132 to 143 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard but pliable threads.  Remove from heat and stir in candies and food coloring until just mixed. Holding each apple by its stick, quickly twirl in syrup, tilting pan to cover apple.  Lift out of syrup, turning to allow drips to adhere to apple.  Place apples on prepared baking sheet to cool completely. This recipe produces a very red, shiny candied apple.  You can substitute a drop of cinnamon oil for the candies.  After the apples are cooled, you can wrap them in colored plastic wrap and tie shut with curling ribbon.  Makes a nice Halloween party treat.
Whisk together the yogurt, honey, mustard, and celery seed in a small bowl. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. This dressing is a must-have because it makes all salads super-yummy. It's so simple! Top your salad with chicken with almonds, spinach and berries, or orange segments. Use your imagination!
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place fish in a 13x9 inch baking dish or pan. Pour butter, marinade, salt and pepper onto and around the fish. Squeeze the lemons onto the fish. Lay tomato slices over the top of the fish. Bake for 30 minutes or until the fish is flaky. A quick and easy fish dish!!
Lightly grease a pie pan. Beat applesauce and white sugar together in a bowl. Add oats, soy milk, 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, vegetable oil, and sea salt; mix well. Fold raisins into oat mixture; pour into prepared pie pan and top with brown sugar and cinnamon. Refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until oatmeal is firm, 35 to 50 minutes. An egg-free and milk-free variation of baked oatmeal. Great if you do not keep eggs around or if you are looking for a vegan version of this classic. It's also not too sweet with less then 1 cup sugar total.
Bring water to a boil in a pressure cooker over high heat. When water is boiling, add potatoes. Seal lid and bring cooker up to high pressure. Reduce heat to low, maintaining high pressure, and cook for 30 minutes. Use quick-release method to lower the pressure. Drain potatoes and return them to pressure cooker. Add butter and milk and cover pressure cooker with lid for 5 minutes, allowing the heat from the potatoes to melt the butter and warm the milk. Remove lid. Season with kosher salt and white pepper, and use a hand masher to mash potatoes until lumps are mostly gone. Transfer to a bowl and serve hot. After years of adjusting, learning from failures, and sorting through advice from others that turned out to be good or bad, I finally have a great recipe that people flip over. The two biggest tips I've learned in making these is to heat the milk and butter before mashing in, and to use a hand masher as opposed to an electric mixer. Using these methods, I have NEVER had the potatoes come out pasty or soupy, always super-fluffy with just enough body.
In a cocktail mixer, shake together the Blue Curacao, coconut rum, vodka and grenadine. Pour into a champagne flute, and fill glass with champagne. A noble drink concocted of Blue Curacao, coconut rum, vodka and champagne. Kinda sweet.
Cut steak into thin strips. In a large heavy skillet, on high heat, brown meat in oil. Add onions. Saute until tender. Blend soup, sherry, liquid from mushrooms, and garlic salt. Pour over steak. Add mushrooms.   Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 1 hour or until steak is tender. Meanwhile, cook the rice. To cook rice: In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Stir in 1 cup of rice. Cover and reduce heat to a simmer. Simmer for 20 minutes. My hubby loves this recipe and it is so simple! Serve it over rice with a nice green salad on the side.
Bring water and sugar to a boil together in a saucepan; stir continually until sugar dissolves. Set aside to cool. Pour sugar-water mixture into a blender with avocados, lime juice, and salt; blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into 10 ice pop molds. Freeze until solid yet still soft, about 2 hours; insert wooden sticks and continue freezing until firm, 12 to 24 hours. Rich and satisfying Mexican ice pops. These are so creamy and delicious! If you like avocados, I guarantee you'll love these pops.
Pour strawberry liqueur and Blue Curacao into a glass with ice. Fill with lemonade. Stir. A luscious mixture of strawberry liqueur, Blue Curacao, and lemonade which I made up - hence the name Luscious Lucy.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain, and transfer to a large bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute chicken until firm and lightly browned; remove from pan. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Cook and stir garlic, asparagus, and red pepper flakes in oil until asparagus is tender. Stir in chicken, and cook for 2 minutes to blend the flavors. Season with salt and pepper. Toss pasta with chicken and asparagus mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. This dish is slightly spicy. It has a unique and awesome taste!
In a small bowl, beat egg yolk with 1 teaspoon water. Crumble cheese, and blend with green onions and egg. Cut pastry into twelve 3 inch squares.  Place a mounded tablespoon of filling in the center of each square.  Moisten edges with water, and fold pastry over filling to form a triangle.  Press edges together firmly with a fork to seal.  Brush tops lightly with egg mixture.  Cover, and chill until ready to bake. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown.  Serve warm, or at room temperature. These can be made ahead, and popped into the oven after your guests arrive. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com. 
In a large salad bowl, combine the salad greens, almonds, feta cheese, apple, red onion and raisins. Toss to blend. Apply salad dressing to individual servings. This easy-to-assemble salad combines the great crunch of apples and almonds with the sweetness of golden raisins and the unique texture of feta cheese. The tanginess of the raspberry dressing works really well with the crispy ingredients.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8 inch square baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and cocoa. In a separate bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, almond extract, and milk. Mix in the dry ingredients using an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Pour half of the batter into the prepared pan. Mix blueberries into the other half, then pour into the pan. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean. Something I came up with while tinkering with a marble-cake recipe that turned out wonderful. To make it in a Bundt pan, double all of the ingredients except the blueberries.
In a large bowl, mix ground turkey, seasoned bread crumbs, onion, egg whites, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper. Form into 12 patties. Cook the patties in a medium skillet over medium heat, turning once, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C). This is a simple and delicious recipe. After making them the first time my husband said 'no more' to beef burgers. These are really good - any cooking method may be used, and they freeze very well. The recipe can also be used for meatballs or meat loaves.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. In a medium bowl, combine garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix together and coat both sides of tri tip. Sear both sides on hot grill then cook 20-25 minutes or until center is light pink. Slice at an angle. This is a simple tri-tip rub recipe straight from a barbeque in Santa Maria.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Beat eggs slightly, stir in white sugar, salt and vanilla. Gradually stir in milk. Add 1/2 cup coconut to filling, and reserve remaining 1/2 cup for the top. Pour filling into pie shell. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until knife inserted into center of pie comes out clean. Cool pie completely. Before serving, mix 1/2 cup coconut with butter and brown sugar. Sprinkle on top of pie. Broil, about 3 or 4 inches away from heat, for 2 to 4 minutes. Competing for 'best pie in the world' prize. With its caramelized topping, this custard pie is something special.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch bread pan. Whisk squash, honey, blueberry syrup, oil, egg, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Mix all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl; add blueberries and walnuts. Stir flour mixture into squash mixture just until combined; pour into prepared bread pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. I started this bread because I needed to bake something to bring as a gift to someone's house and quickly found that my ingredients were limited to a few summertime fruits and veggies and not much else. As such, I improvised and changed a few things around from a zucchini bread recipe and created this healthy, hearty, summertime bread. It has a slightly different flavor than zucchini bread but the same moist consistency and sweet, summery taste and smell. Note: it is not very sweet and does taste 'healthy', so it's probably not a big hit for kids unless chocolate chips are added.
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Crumble ground beef into the pot; cook and stir until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add water, corn, tomatoes, ranch-style beans, potatoes, onion, green bell pepper, celery, chili powder, sugar, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper to the beef; stir. Cover the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook at a simmer until potatoes are tender, about 1 hour. Hearty and easy-perfect for the cowgirl (or cowboy) in all of us! Can also be made in a slow cooker.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the confectioners' sugar, cocoa, flour and salt until well blended. Cut in the butter until lumps are no larger than peas. Add eggs and vanilla; mix until a stiff dough forms. It may take a minute to come together. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. If the dough is too sticky, chill for a little bit. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the surface appears dry. Allow cookies to cool for a couple minutes on the baking sheet before removing to wire racks to cool completely. When cookies are completely cool, melt the chocolate over a double boiler or in the microwave. Stir frequently until smooth. Dip cookies or drizzle with the chocolate and place on waxed paper to set. These extra chocolaty cookies will cast a chocolate spell on you. Once you have eaten them, you will want nothing else. Serve with ice cream and coffee. If you can't find Dutch process cocoa at your store, just add a pinch of baking soda to the dry ingredients. They are great with frosting too!
In a medium bowl, beat the eggs well.  Stir in sugar, butter or margarine, corn syrup, oatmeal, vanilla, and salt.  Pour mixture into the pie shell, and top with coconut.

To Make Apple Filling: Place apples in a large bowl. Add white sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Toss until all ingredients are mixed well and apples are thoroughly coated. Spoon half of apple filling into pastry-lined deep-dish pan. Top with half of caramels and half of taffy mixture. Repeat process with remaining apple filling, caramels and taffy mixture. Place top pastry over filling and seal well (this is very important--if edges are not sealed, caramel will leak out all over). Cut steam vents and brush top crust with milk or light cream. Cover pie with foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil from pie and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes, until crust is golden. Serve warm.

Roast in the preheated oven until the fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 10 minutes. Brush salmon with the reserved marinade, and return to the oven. Roast until glazed, about 1 minute. These simple and few ingredients make for quick but elegant entertaining. The final broiling caramelizes the sugar to give the salmon its attractive, mildly sweet glaze.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Mix ground beef, jalapeno chile pepper, and honey with your hands in a large bowl; shape into 4 even patties. Cook on preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 10 minutes per side for well done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). This sweet and spicy twist makes for a not-so-ordinary burger. Using only two simple ingredients, honey and jalapeno, who would have ever thought it would be so tasty! I use a counter-top grill that cooks both sides at the same time. It cuts down on grilling time and also reduces fat. I make four equal-sized patties and grill for only about 5 minutes total.
Preheat oven to broil. Place poblano chile peppers on a cookie sheet and place in oven. Allow skin to blacken and blister, turning the chile peppers until all sides are done. (Note: Do not overcook.)

Season with salt, black pepper, white pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, oregano, cumin and paprika. Whisk until well blended, then pour over the steak in the dish. Turn over once to coat both sides. Cover with plastic wrap, and marinate for 1 to 8 hours. In a small bowl, stir together 1 chopped white onion, cilantro, and the juice of 1 lime. Set aside to use as a relish for the tacos. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Toast chile pods in the skillet for a few minutes, then remove to a bowl of water to soak for about 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place the tomatoes, 1 onion, jalapenos, and 4 cloves of garlic onto a baking sheet. Roast in the oven for about 20 minutes, until toasted but not burnt.  Place the roasted vegetables, and soaked chile pods into a blender or food processor, along with salt and pepper. Puree until smooth. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cut the marinated flank steak into cubes or strips. Cook, stirring constantly, until the meat is cooked through and most of the liquid has evaporated. Warm the tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them pliable. Tortillas may also be warmed in a microwave oven. Arrange two or three tortillas on a plate, and lay a generous amount of beef over them. Top with a sprinkle of the onion relish and a large spoonful of the pureed salsa. Add as much cheese as you like. Garnish with lime wedges, and serve. This is a great recipe for authentic Mexican taqueria style carne asada tacos (beef tacos). These are served on the soft corn tortillas, unlike the American version of tacos.
Combine bread crumbs and salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Add scallops, a few at a time, and shake to coat. Repeat with remaining scallops. Melt butter in olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; fry scallops until browned and opaque, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a plate and keep warm. Stir wine, lemon juice, parsley, and garlic into skillet and bring to a boil. Simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour lemon-wine sauce over scallops to serve. A fast but gourmet meal for dinner guests, these sea scallops are sure to impress!
Pour chicken broth into a large saucepan, and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced by about 1/3. Pour in both cans of the tomatoes, and return to a simmer. Pour in the half-and-half, and turn heat to low. Simmer for 15 minutes. Puree in batches in a blender, or use an immersion blender in the pan. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls, and swirl in a spoonful of pesto before serving. Quick and creamy tomato soup with pesto.  You can spice this up with hot sauce or chile oil if you like it hot.
Fill a tall glass with ice. Pour the orange vodka, raspberry vodka, rum, orange juice, pineapple juice, and grenadine over the ice; stir well. Garnish with an orange wedge. This is a refreshing, fruity cocktail.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toast almonds in oven for 10 minutes or until brown. Dissolve coffee in 2 tablespoons hot water.  In a separate small mixing bowl mix flour, baking soda and salt. Beat butter and sugar in an electric mixer at a medium speed until fluffy. Pour coffee, vanilla and eggs into the butter mixture; mix well. Reduce mixer's speed to low and slowly pour flour mixture into the butter mixture. Fold chocolate chips and almonds into the dough. Drop dough by teaspoonfuls onto an ungreased cookie sheet, 3 inches apart. Bake for 10 minutes. These cookies are a step above any you have ever tasted.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Season the steaks on both sides with Cajun seasoning and black pepper. Place the steaks into the prepared baking dish. Pour the lemon-lime beverage over them. Combine the cream of mushroom soup and dry onion soup mix, and pour over the steaks. Bake, uncovered, for about 1 hour, or until meat reaches desired doneness. Do not open the oven door during the first hour of cooking. Serve steaks with gravy spooned over. These steaks are wonderful and easy to make.  They also make their own gravy.  Wonderful served with rice.
In a medium bowl, mix together artichoke hearts, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, garlic powder, seasoning salt, soy sauce and hot pepper sauce. Chill in the refrigerator until serving. This is the best artichoke dip you will ever taste in your whole life. The secret is in the seasonings. The tasty blend of Parmesan and Monterey Jack cheeses doesn't hurt, either!
Mix 2 cups water (or amount needed to cover the zucchini) and pickling lime together in a nonreactive bowl. Place the zucchini slices in a large (at least 1-gallon) glass jar or large crock, and pour the lime mixture over the zucchini. The solution should completely cover the zucchini. Cover the jar with plastic wrap, and allow to stand for 24 hours. Drain the zucchini slices in a colander in the sink; thoroughly wash the glass jar. Rinse the zucchini slices very well under running water to rinse away all the lime, and place the slices back into the jar. Cover with fresh cool water, allow to stand for 2 to 3 hours, and drain away the water. Rinse again. Place the zucchini slices into a large pot, and stir in 1 cup vinegar, the alum, food coloring, and 2 more cups water (or enough water to cover the zucchini slices). Bring to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer the zucchini slices for 2 hours. Drain the zucchini slices, and discard the liquid. Place the zucchini slices back into the glass jar. Mix together 1 cup of vinegar, 3 more cups of water, the sugar, cinnamon sticks, and red hot candies in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and stir until the sugar and candies dissolve. Pour the syrup over the zucchini slices. Allow the zucchini to stand covered for 24 hours. Drain, and reserve the syrup. Bring the syrup to a full rolling boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Sterilize the canning jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the zucchini slices into the hot, sterilized jars, and pour the hot syrup into the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 20 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area. You can use cucumbers, zucchini, or apples to make these homemade spiced rings.  My family can't tell the difference from apples to zucchini. It is easy but takes a couple of minutes each day for about a week to make.  Well worth the small effort!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).  Grease an 8 inch square pan. Cut cold butter into 1/4 inch cubes.  Toss cubes with baking mix until coated.  Beat 1/2 cup milk and egg together; stir into butter mixture. Turn dough onto cloth covered board generously dusted with baking mix; roll to coat.  Fold and knead 10 times.  Roll into a 15 x 8 inch rectangle.  Spread with softened butter or margarine.  Mix sugar and cinnamon, and sprinkle over dough.  Roll up tightly, beginning at 15 inch side.  Pinch edge into roll.  Cut into 12 slices with a sharp knife.  Place cut sides down in prepared pan. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes.  Remove from oven, and cool for 15 minutes. Mix confectioners sugar and  1 tablespoon milk until smooth.  Drizzle over cinnamon buns.  Serve. Nothing beats cinnamon buns on a cold morning.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat, and brown pork chops on both sides. Remove chops, reserving pan dripping. Arrange tater tots in a single layer in the prepared baking dish. Layer green beans over the tater tots. Place browned chops over the beans. In a bowl, mix reserved pan drippings, cream of celery soup, sour cream, salt, and pepper. Pour evenly over chops. Cover dish with foil, and bake casserole 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until pork chops are done. My husband introduced this to me years ago, and my children absolutely love this casserole - they ask for it weekly.
Season chicken breasts all over with salt and black pepper. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken breasts in hot oil until browned, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Pour salsa and chicken broth over chicken, bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn chicken over, stir salsa mixture, and continue to simmer until chicken is tender and sauce is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). This easy-to-make recipe is a great weeknight family dish I threw together, and we enjoyed it a lot. Delicious with rice. Can also be shredded and served with tortillas.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Cut in the shortening until the mixture is coarse and crumbly. Stir in the egg.  I use my hands to mix it all together, it just seems easier. Press about half of the mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Spread the raspberry preserves over the crust then sprinkle with the remaining crumb mixture. Bake for about 35 to 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly toasted. Careful not to overcook. Cool in the pan on a wire rack. Then cut into squares, enjoy! One of the quickest, tastiest bar cookie recipes I've used. You can alter the taste by changing fruit preserve flavors. It's a perfect cookie to bring to any pot luck function, but make sure you bring the recipe too, people will ask for it!

Can be made from store bought ready made pie crust.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the ground turkey meat until browned and crumbly, breaking the meat apart as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Drain excess fat if necessary, and place into a bowl. Bring enough water to cover the frozen vegetables (about 2 cups) to a boil in a saucepan, then stir in the mixed vegetables; bring back to a boil over medium heat, cook until tender, about 5 minutes, then drain. Place the mixed vegetables in the bowl with the turkey. Mix the 2 packets of turkey gravy mix with 2 cups of water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat, and simmer until the mixture comes to a boil. Simmer about 2 minutes to thicken. Pour the gravy into the bowl with the turkey and vegetables, and mix well. Stir the 2 packages of pie crust mix with the ice water, adding the water 1 tablespoon at a time and stirring it in with a fork, until the mixture forms a soft dough. Gather the dough together, and cut in half; cut each half into 4 pieces (8 pieces in all). Roll each piece out on a floured surface to about 6 inches square, then fit 4 pie crusts into the mini-loaf pans; retain the other 4 crusts. Spoon 1/4 of the turkey and vegetable mixture into each pan. Top each pie with another crust, then use a fork to crimp the 2 crusts together to seal. Cut away excess dough. Using a sharp knife, make 4 small slits into the top crust of each pie. Place the pies onto a baking sheet, and bake in the preheated oven until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is hot, 15 to 20 minutes. Allow to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This is a delicious, easy, fun and affordable meal for the whole family.
Set a slow cooker on Low, and put in half of the butter to melt. Add the onions and apples; cover and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours. After the cooking time is up and apples and onions are soft, pour in the brandy, chicken broth and apple cider. Set the slow cooker to High and cook for 1 to 2 hours, until simmering. Preheat the oven broiler. Mix together the cinnamon, sugar and remaining butter. Spread onto one side of each slice of bread. Place bread cinnamon side up on a baking sheet, and broil until toasted, about 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, flip the slices over so the cinnamon is on the bottom. Sprinkle Gouda cheese on the top and return to the broiler until the cheese is melted. Ladle soup into serving bowls and top with slices of toast, cheese side up to serve. This is an awesome autumn twist on the traditional French Onion soup.  Apple cider and brandy make it a cozy dish for those chilly fall afternoons.

Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine. Select the Dough setting, and press Start. Mix the bread for 3 to 5 minutes until the bananas are mashed and all ingredients are thoroughly combined. If necessary, use a rubber spatula to push the dough from the sides of the bread pan. When 3 to 5 minutes have passed on the clock display, press Stop. Do not continue mixing. Smooth out the top of the loaf with the rubber spatula. Select the Bake setting, and press Start. The Bake cycle time may vary with machines, but should be about 50 minutes. To test the bread for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center top. Remove the toothpick. If the bread is done, the toothpick will come out clean. If there is batter on the toothpick, reset the machine on Bake and continue to bake an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Test again with the toothpick to ensure the bread is completely baked. Remove the pan from the machine, but allow the bread to remain in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove the bread to cool completely on a wire rack. A quick banana bread for the bread machine. Use the DOUGH setting for mixing, then BAKE with the control set to light.

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix sugar, salt, garlic salt and tomato sauce into ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, cover skillet, and cool to room temperature. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes. Drain and cool slightly. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion in a bowl. Scoop half the noodles into the prepared casserole dish; top with half the sour cream mixture. Spoon half the ground beef mixture atop sour cream layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients. Top casserole with Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until Cheddar cheese has browned, 25 to 30 minutes. As the title suggests, this was my Grandmother's recipe. I've tweaked the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on what I've got in the fridge and it always turns out great! My mother has suggested this was made up as a way to use up ingredients in the fridge.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Combine brownie mix, oil, egg and water in a large bowl.   Stir 50 strokes with a spoon. Place batter in a cupcake pan (cupcake wrappers recommended).  Once cups are 3/4 of the way full, place an unwrapped miniature peanut butter cup in the middle, then bake for 30-35 minutes keeping an eye on them while they're baking.   Let them cool and then they're ready to eat!! This is a yummy treat that everyone will love!!

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 36 cupcake cups with paper liners. In a bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt until thoroughly combined and sifted. In a large mixing bowl, beat 1 cup of unsalted butter until fluffy with an electric mixer set on medium speed. Mix in 2 cups of sugar and the lemon pudding mix, and beat on high speed until very fluffy and well combined, about 8 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time. With the electric mixer running, beat in milk in 1/3 cup increments, alternating with the flour mixture; beat in vanilla extract, lemon juice, and lemon zest just until mixed. Fill the prepared cupcake cups about 2/3 full with the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until the cupcakes are lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 23 minutes. Allow the cupcakes to cool. When cupcakes are cool, make filling; pour about 2 inches of water into the bottom of a double boiler, place over medium heat, and bring the water to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer, and place the egg whites and 2/3 cup of sugar into the top of the double boiler. Do not allow the water to touch the upper part of the double boiler. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, and mix with electric mixer set on high speed until the meringue holds soft peaks, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to medium, and beat in the butter, 2 or 3 tablespoons at a time. When butter is smoothly beaten in, beat the creme de menthe candy flavoring oil in until the flavoring is fully incorporated and the filling is fluffy, 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove filling from heat and set aside. When cooled, load the filling into a piping bag with a medium-sized round tip. To make the frosting, place cream cheese, raspberries, both amounts of tea powder, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup of sugar in a bowl, and beat until smooth with an electric mixer set on high speed. While mixer is running, slowly pour the cream into the bowl, and beat until the frosting forms stiff peaks, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl often. Insert the piping tip into the top of each cupcake, and squeeze about half a tablespoon of filling into each cupcake. Top each cupcake with a generous dollop of frosting to serve. This is a recipe I submitted in a cupcake contest our local chocolate boutique was hosting. Despite warnings that I should stick with something including chocolate, I went with my instinct and won first prize! These cupcakes taste very similar to a popular, commercially available raspberry tea.

Sprinkle over cake batter. Bake at 375 degree F (190 degrees C) for 25-30 minutes. I make this at least twice when blueberries are in season. Makes a great coffeecake or dessert.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut a slice off the stem end of each pepper, and use a sharp paring knife or pepper corer to scoop out the veins and seeds from the peppers (wear rubber gloves and avoid touching your eyes or nose). Mix together the cream cheese, Gouda cheese, bacon bits, pineapple, and about 1 teaspoon of reserved pineapple juice, or as needed to make a workable filling, in a bowl until thoroughly blended. Using a small spoon, stuff the hollow peppers with the cheese mixture. Place a rack or several disposable foil bread pans upside down onto a baking sheet. (See notes for how to make a pepper rack from a foil pan.) Stand the peppers, stem sides up, into the rack, and bake in the preheated oven until the peppers are softened and the filling is hot and bubbly, 30 to 45 minutes. This is a great appetizer for any BBQ or grilled meal. I always make them camping. I looked through many recipes, and finally decided on this. I love the sweetness of the pineapple and the slight smoky flavor of the gouda. You can also dice jalapeno to add to the cheese mix.   
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix dry ingredients and set aside. Cream sugars, butter or margarine and vanilla.  Beat in eggs and when smooth add dry ingredients. Next add the coconut followed by the marshmallows and finally the chips.  They will break up the marshmallows with the beater action. Drop small scoop onto ungreased cookie sheets.  Bake 10 minutes and remove from oven.  Let sit on tray for several minutes to let the marshmallows dry.  This will make it easier to get off the tray.  Store in a tight-fitted container. When my son was 4, he wanted a gooey chocolate chip cookie and he thought up these additions to a basic chocolate chip cookie.  Vanishes around teenagers both big and small.
Prepare and bake cake mix according to package directions for one 9x13 inch cake. Remove cake from oven. Poke holes at once down through cake to pan with the round handle of a wooden spoon. Holes should be at 1 inch intervals. Combine the pudding mix with the confectioners' sugar and gradually stir in the milk. Beat with an electric mixer at low speed for not more than 1 minute. Do not  over beat. Quickly, before pudding thickens, pour about 1/2 of the thin pudding evenly over the warm cake and into the holes. (This will make the stripes in the cake.) Allow the remaining pudding to thicken slightly then spoon over the top, and spread to frost the top of the cake. Chill for at least 1 hour before serving. Store leftovers in the refrigerator. This is a yellow or white cake in which holes are poked after baking, and chocolate pudding is pored over it, making it look like it has stripes when it is cut.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. In a large skillet, saute garlic and oregano in olive oil for 1-2 minutes.  Add butternut squash and saute for 8-10 minutes.  Add zucchini and saute for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook pasta 1 minute under required cooking time and reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Add 1 cup of cooking liquid to the skillet and bring to a simmer.  Add cooked pasta to the sauce and cook for 1 minute.  The sauce should become creamy.  Remove from heat and toss with cheese. Hearty butternut squash and zucchini tossed with PLUS multigrain pasta and Pecorino cheese and fresh oregano make a quick, healthy, and delicious weeknight meal.
Melt butter in a small skillet. Pepper the skillet with 1/2 tablespoon of the pepper, then lay the chicken breast onto the pepper. Squeeze fresh lemon juice onto the chicken, then season with the remaining pepper. Saute chicken breast for about 5 to 7 minutes, then turn to the other side, squeeze lemon juice onto the other side and saute for another 5 to 7 minutes (or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear). A simple, single-serving lunch or dinner. Chicken breasts sauteed with butter, fresh lemon juice and fresh ground black pepper. That's it - and that's enough for this tasty, tangy lemony peppery dish.
In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking soda, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, ground ginger, and ground cloves. In a separate bowl cream together the sugar and butter or margarine.

You should have about 4 cups when finished. Sprinkle the zucchini with 1 teaspoon of the salt and place on a plate. Mix it with your hands to evenly distribute the salt. Place a heavy saucepan on top of the zucchini and allow it to sit for 20 minutes to purge itself of liquid. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans and set aside. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the flour. Sift together the remaining flour, soda, spices, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Beat eggs on medium speed for about 3 minutes. Add the sugar, a little at a time and beat for a good 5 minutes. The mixture should be light in color and thick. While beating, slowly pour in the oil. Empty the zucchini into a colander and squeeze to release the juices. Add the vanilla to the beating eggs and then add in the zucchini. Add the dry ingredients, a little at a time and mix just until the dry ingredients are mixed in. Do not overmix. In a small bowl combine the remaining 2 tablespoons flour, nuts, and drained raisins, and mix together to coat. Fold into the batter. Pour into the prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) about 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean. Remove to a rack to cool for 10 minutes. Remove from pans and cool on a rack completely.

(Always stir in same direction.) Pour fudge onto buttered plates or waxed paper.  Let cool and cut into 1-inch pieces. This is my grandpa's famous family recipe that he guarded almost all my life, but it's such a good treat I had to share it! Makes a great gift for friends, your kid's teacher, co-workers, or anyone really!
Place the beans and water in a large stockpot. Add the ham hock, onion and garlic. Season with chili powder, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, and cook for 2 minutes. Cover, and remove from heat. Let stand for one hour. Return the pot to the heat, and bring to a boil once again. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for at least 3 hours to blend flavors. The longer you simmer, the thicker the broth will become. I like to cook mine for about 6 hours. Remove the ham hock from the broth, and let cool. Remove the meat from the bone, and return the meat to the stockpot, discarding the bone. Adjust seasonings to taste. This is the same recipe my mother's side of the family has been making for years, with my own special touch. Serve it with all of the fixin's. It goes great with cornbread, fried potatoes and fried cabbage.
Pour half the jar of Alfredo sauce into the slow cooker; top with a layer of lasagna noodles. Spread a layer of spinach, a layer of mushrooms, and a layer of crabmeat, respectively, over lasagna noodle layer. Spoon half the cottage cheese and half the ricotta cheese over crabmeat layer. Repeat layering with remaining ingredients, ending with a final layer of noodles and Alfredo sauce. Cook on High for 2 hours 15 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over lasagna on cook on High until cheese is melted, about 30 minutes more. Spinach, crab, mushrooms, and lasagna are my hubby's favorite foods. Combine in the slow cooker and wow. I about shocked myself at how good this turned out! You can substitute real crab or shrimp for mock crab.  If you turn off the slow cooker and allow lasagna to cool after the 30 minutes after adding mozzarella cheese, it will stick together better!
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Quickly saute shrimp until they turn pink, but are not cooked through; remove from skillet and set aside.  Add the bell peppers, onion, garlic, fennel seeds, and thyme; cook until the onion softens, about 8 minutes. Stir in white wine, tomato paste, and diced tomatoes.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the flavors blend, about 10 minutes.  Add the shrimp, and simmer until they are cooked and turn opaque, about 3 minutes.  Stir in the basil, and season to taste with salt and pepper before serving. For a gourmet meal this is very easy to prepare.  Leftovers reheat well the next day too!  Instead of using fresh shrimp like the recipe originally called (took too long the first time I did it) we now use frozen, raw, peeled and it tastes the exact same, but with 1/4 of the time! This is great over rice and served with French bread.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the egg and vanilla.

Broil on top rack of preheated oven until the skins begin to blacken, about 5 minutes. Place charred vegetables into a bowl and seal with plastic wrap to steam until their skins loosen. Lower oven rack to accommodate a roasting pan, and turn oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Meanwhile, pour vegetable oil into a roasting pan (or skillet large enough to fit the turkey), and place over medium-high heat. When hot, add the turkey and sear on all sides until browned, about 10 minutes. Once the turkey has been browned, place breast side up into the roasting pan, and stuff with quartered apples and olives. Set aside. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ancho chiles, pumpkin seeds, and bay leaves. Cook and stir until the pumpkin seeds begin to smell toasted, about 5 minutes, then pour the mixture into a blender. Once the tomatoes and peppers have steamed enough that the skins have loosened, remove and discard the skins. Place tomatoes, green peppers, and onion into the blender with the pumpkin seeds. Blend until you have a thick, smooth sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste, adding a little liquid from the olives if desired. Brush the sauce onto the turkey, and place into preheated oven. Cook until a meat thermometer inserted in the meaty part of the thigh reads 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 3 hours, basting occasionally. My Salvadorian mother-in-law taught me this recipe, and it's become our family's favorite.  I want everyone to enjoy it like we do!
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Slice the tops off of the eggplants, and place on a baking sheet with the red pepper halves. Drizzle with olive oil to lightly coat. Bake for about 40 minutes in the preheated oven, until eggplant is tender. Remove from the oven, and place the eggplant and peppers into a large resealable bag. Seal, and let sit for 15 minutes to loosen the skin. Remove from the bag, peel off the skins, and dice the eggplants and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl. Place the tomatoes, and garlic in to the bowl with the roasted vegetables, and season with salt, pepper and cilantro. Mix until well blended. Set aside. Set the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Peel apart the pita breads into two thin circles. You may cut off the edges to make it easier. Brush melted butter onto what used to be the inside, and stack together. Cut into strips, then cut across at a diagonal to make diamond shapes. If you have kitchen scissors, it will be easy. Place them on a baking sheet. Bake the pita chips for 5 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly toasted. Stir occasionally if they overlap. I was in the produce aisle admiring the beautiful eggplants and I kinda said out loud 'hmmm... wonder what I could do with those?' and a woman answered, 'I always make salsa!'  SALSA??? So I figured I give it a shot.. and scribbled down her recipe!  YUM!
Place the dry rice noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water, and let soak until white and soft but not mushy, about 10 minutes. Drain and set aside. Bring a small pot of water to a boil; cook the broccoli in the boiling water until cooked and still firm, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and set aside. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the sliced steak; cover the skillet and cook until the meat is just turning from pink to grey, 5 to 7 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper. Allow the mixture to simmer while you prepare the egg. Prepare a small skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-low heat. Cook the egg in the prepared skillet until cooked through and the yolk is solid. Add the cooked egg to the other skillet and stir to incorporate. Serve hot. A popular Thai soy sauce noodle dish.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Cook pasta in boiling water until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken breast, and cook until browned on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and capers, and continue cooking until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes longer. Remove chicken from pan. Using the same pan, add asparagus, broccoli, mushrooms, and water to the juices remaining in the pan. Cover, and simmer until the broccoli and asparagus are tender. Layer pasta, chicken, and vegetables in a large platter or bowl to serve. My best friend's mom used to make us a version of this in high school. It is very light, and you can add pretty much anything you want!
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Allow yeast to sit until it begins to form bubbles. Add honey, butter, and salt to the yeast mixture.  Stir in flours one cup at a time, beginning with the rye.  When the dough begins to stiffen, turn it out on to a well floured surface.  Knead for 5 minutes, adding flour as needed.  Place into a greased bowl, and turn once to oil the surface of the dough.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Allow to rise in a warm place until doubled, approximately 1 to 2 hours. Punch down dough, and knead again until smooth.  Split into 3 loaves, and knead for a few more minutes.  Place loaves in three oiled pans.  Allow to rise until double, 1 to 2 hours. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown.  Cool in pans for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto counter or wire rack to completely cool. I am not sure why this is called Milk and Honey Loaf.  There is no milk in the recipe.  I have only recently started making bread, and this is the recipe a friend started me with.  It has been passed from person to person for some time, and is very easy.
Two days before serving, boil potatoes whole, with skins, until tender, about 25 minutes. When you can insert a fork and remove it easily, they are done. Drain, and refrigerate. The day before serving, peel and grate the potatoes. I like to use a food processor with grating attachment. Place the potatoes into a large bowl and toss gently with melted butter, half-and-half, onion, salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate. The day of the meal, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 1 hour, uncovered. You may broil for a minute at the end to brown the top if you like. A terrific alternative to tired mashed potatoes for holiday meals. This dish must be started two days before serving but on the day of your meal, all you have to do is pop it in the oven.  I don't know who Ricci is but this came through my family in Syracuse.
Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mash the potatoes, and set aside. Sprinkle chicken tenders with steak seasoning; heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the chicken tenders until the meat is lightly browned and no longer pink inside, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Remove the chicken, and set aside. Stir the maple syrup into the skillet, scraping up and dissolving any browned flavor bits from the skillet. Bring to a boil, simmer for 2 minutes, and stir in the green onions. To serve, place the mashed sweet potatoes onto a serving platter, top with the chicken tenders, and pour the maple sauce over the chicken. A sweet and slightly tangy option for chicken and potatoes.

It's a family favorite. Don't forget the crusty Italian bread for dipping! A traditional bruschetta goes well with this also. Although not included in recipe, you can add some cut green pepper with vegetables and throw in some sliced mushrooms for last 1/2 hour if you like. This is my recipe so feel free to make it yours.

Stir the sugar and warm water together in a bowl until the sugar dissolves completely; add the fish sauce, vinegar,  lemon juice, garlic, Thai chile peppers, and green onion to the mixture. My personal take on a traditional dipping sauce. A little bit sweet, but mostly savory with a nice bit of heat. I make this a minimum of 24 hours before I use it to let the flavors mingle. Leftover sauce can be kept for three to four weeks in a sealed container in the refrigerator. If this isn't to your taste as written, experiment! Everyone's tastes are different! Some like their nuoc cham really sweet and mild, some like it tangy with heat. Mine tends to be more towards the tangy heat side. So, before you add the garlic, onion, and vinegar, sample it and adjust the ingredient amounts to suit your liking. Keep in mind that this recipe is LOUD when you first make it. The flavors mingle and mature a bit after the first 24 hours. I hope you enjoy!

To Make Frosting:  Combine 2 cups confectioners' sugar,   2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons milk, and 1 teaspoon maple extract.  Spread over cooled cookies. These are the best with a glass of milk on a cold day.  My husband says they taste like maple bars.
Slice the calamari tubes open so they can lay flat. Rinse and pat dry; set aside. Mix the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese together in a pie tin or on a plate. Pour the milk into a separate dish. Dip the calamari steaks in milk, then press into the bread crumb mixture to coat. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Quickly add the steaks and cook until golden brown on each side, about 3 minutes per side. They should be golden brown but be careful not to over cook or they will be tough. Reduce heat to low and add garlic and then spaghetti sauce to the pan. Top each steak with a slice of provolone cheese. Cover with a lid just until the cheese has melted, about 2 minutes. This recipe is almost like Chicken Parmigiano, but it uses calamari steaks, and is much quicker and easier to make. It is not baked, and the uniform texture of the steaks allows the breading to adhere nicely. Serve over your favorite pasta with extra sauce, if desired.

Tonja was born in the 1940's and this is her cousin Toni's boyfriend's grandmother's eggnog, so I'm guessing this is from  the mid-1800's and probably dates much earlier. The original recipe called for half milk and half cream, but I use half and half.  Delicious and simple, but be warned, Granny apparently liked a kick!  I've made it from scratch and with the modern equivalents and it's fantastic either way.  Do yourself a favor and use a mixer for everything.  Those who like eggnog LOVE this recipe.  I never leave a party with leftovers.
In a stockpot over medium heat, brown the ground beef until no longer pink. Drain off grease, reserving 2 tablespoons to remain in the pan.

If you like your chili soupy, add only 2 cans of beans, but if you like thick chili, use all three. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes to blend flavors. This is a Texas style chili recipe with beans. It also uses hamburger rather than chuck. Leaving behind a small amount of the hamburger fat gives it that unique Texas chili taste.

When they went out of business, we looked for someone else that made these two soups, without much luck. Knowing all the ingredients that were there, I went to work to make my own recipe for this very tasty soup. Plus I'm a big fan of 'make it tasty, fast and easy' which this is, when I run the veggies through my food processor. Also when I not feel well, this is one soup that has all what help me feel better.  I also serve this with steamed rice as a side dish for those who want it as well.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Pour the olive oil into a roasting pan. Place the turkey legs into the oil; turn the legs over several times to coat with oil. Sprinkle each leg with salt, black pepper, and thyme; pull the leaves from 3 sprigs of rosemary and sprinkle onto the turkey legs. Place the remaining 3 sprigs of rosemary around the legs in the oil. Place butter pieces on the legs; sprinkle each leg with garlic and scatter the onion in the pan. Roast the legs in the preheated oven until the turkey skin is browned and the juices run clear, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, basting every 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and turn the legs over in the pan. Roast for 1 hour, basting every 20 minutes. Reduce oven heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and roast until the skin is golden brown, about 1 more hour. Remove the turkey legs to a serving platter. To make gravy, move the roasting pan with the oil and drippings to a burner set on medium heat; whisk in the cooking wine and brown sugar, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Use the whisk to scrape up and dissolve any brown flavor bits left in the bottom of the pan. Whisk in the flour, a little at a time, and stir until the flour is smoothly incorporated into the mixture; pour in the chicken stock and whisk constantly until the gravy comes to a simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Stir in the gravy browning sauce; allow the gravy to simmer for 3 to 5 minutes and serve with the roasted turkey legs. Unless you're deep-frying turkey, I suggest you make the switch over to this method of cooking turkey, even for holidays and special occasions. Alter the amount of ingredients depending on the number of people attending your amazing turkey feast; my version is for three people.

Bake (lightly pressing on foil if dough starts to balloon) until fluting turns golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove all foil; bake until bottom starts to turn golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Remove shell from oven. To make filling: Adjust oven rack to middle position and reduce temperature to 300 degrees. In a separate pie plate, toast pecans in oven until fragrant, about 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 250. Meanwhile, heat brown sugar and corn syrup in a medium heat-proof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water until sugar is almost dissolved. In another medium bowl, whisk eggs, yolks, vanilla and salt. Slowly whisk warm sugar mixture into eggs. Return bowl to pan of simmering water. Whisk in butter. In a small pan over low heat, stir together cornstarch and water until pasty thick; whisk into sugar-egg mixture. Heat in bowl over simmering water, stirring frequently. Set pie shell on middle oven rack. Sprinkle in pecans, then pour filling into shell. Bake until pie puffs slightly and just sets, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool to room temperature and serve. Of all pies, pecan is one of the trickiest to make. The problem is in the crust. A fat-filled dough is tender, flaky and flavorful, but likely to tear during rolling and to develop tiny holes during baking. Naturally, the lava-like pecan-pie filling seeps into these openings, baking rock-hard onto the pie plate. A lean crust, on the other hand, is sturdy, but tough and dry. The crust I've developed offers the best of both styles: The following recipe is rich and tender, yet baker-friendly. Bonus: This silky-smooth filling tastes a little less treacly sweet, a plus for most pecan pie lovers.
Process cucumber chunks in a food processor until finely chopped. Put chopped cucumber and white onion in a piece of cheesecloth and twist to squeeze into a bowl as much liquid as possible from the vegetables, reserving the liquid. Assure the food processor bowl is dry before returning cucumber and onion mixture to the food processor. Add cream cheese, dill, hot pepper sauce, green food coloring, and cayenne pepper. Process the mixture until smooth, scraping down the sides of the food processor bowl a few times to make sure everything is integrated. If too thick, add reserved liquid a teaspoon at a time. This Louisville staple is an easy and refreshing cucumber spread or dip and can be served with almost anything you could imagine. Dipping club crackers or pita and French bread toast points are favorites, but carrot sticks and pretzels are great too. We use it for cucumber sandwiches, spread it onto our BLTs, and use it as a sauce on poached salmon. You can serve it immediately or refrigerate it to firm up and let the flavors meld.
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large skillet and cook and stir shallot and garlic until shallot is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir 1 3/4 tablespoon Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and basil into the hot olive oil, cooking until basil is tender and wilted, about 10 more minutes. Stir 1 cup cream into basil mixture and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce until it has reduced by 1/3, about 15 minutes. Stir remaining 1/2 cup cream into sauce and simmer until thickened again, 15 to 30 more minutes. Stir occasionally. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat and cook chicken until lightly browned outside and no longer pink inside, 10 to 12 minutes.

Gently fold cooked pasta and chicken into basil sauce. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. This is a pesto cream sauce where you make the pesto ahead and freeze in portions to use for another night. I got this recipe from a restaurant in Green Bay called St. Brenden's. I usually make this on a Saturday afternoon when I have some free time (and freeze it all), but I have made it on a week night and only froze two portions. Triple the pesto ingredients and use one portion tonight; freeze the rest for later.
Place the pork, onion, cinnamon, and clove into a saucepan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour in water to just cover the meat. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until the water has nearly evaporated, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally to ensure the pork cooks evenly.

Are you sick 'n' tired of dried-out, tough pork chops? I was until I came up with this recipe. The trick to cooking meat and poultry is to know your internal temperatures. That is why you should invest in an instant-read, digital meat thermometer. I will NOT cook without one. And another thing people don't realize is that today's pork does NOT have to cook till it gets to 160 to 170 degrees F internal temperature. I like to serve these with some garlic smashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. Melt about 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.

Add more butter to the skillet and continue with remaining slices.  Melt remaining butter in the microwave at 15 second intervals. Place finished toast onto plates, drizzle with melted butter, and dust with confectioners' sugar. This recipe comes from my brother's kitchen in New Mexico, he is a great cook.
In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in lukewarm, scalded milk.  Add 2 cups flour.  Stir well, and allow to rest 1 hour in a warm place. Warm the milk in a small saucepan until it bubbles, then remove from heat and let cool until lukewarm. Soften chopped raisins in warm water for 30 minutes. Beat egg, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla, melted butter or margarine, salt, and orange rind.  Add to yeast sponge. Stir in raisins. Stir in egg mixture.  Blend well.  Add 4 cups flour.   Mix well, forming smooth ball.  Dough will be somewhat soft, but not "batter-like."  Cover dough, and allow to rise until fully doubled.  Punch down, let rise until double again. Roll dough into 1/2 inch balls, set aside to rise until doubled in bulk. In a deep-fryer, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Drop 2 or 3 at a time into hot fat, turn when deep golden brown.  If removed too soon, dough will be undone inside. When done drain briefly and dust with confectioners' sugar before serving. This is the 'traditional' ponczki made by most Polish Grandmothers, like mine.  These take time and patience, but the product is worth it. Preferred, traditional frying method is with lard but oil will work fine.  I usually mix equal portions.  Grandma used a large paper bag, and dropped them in immediately after removing from the fryer.  The bag absorbs a lot of the oil.  Then, she transferred them to another clean bag, added her choice of coating, and shook the bag.
Remove the stems, seeds, and membranes from the ancho chiles and guajillo chiles, then soak in hot water until softened, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil. Remove the stems from the tomatoes, then cut a shallow X on the bottom. Drop the tomatoes into the water, and cook uncovered until the skin begins to peel off, about 30 seconds. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes until cold to stop the cooking process. Once the tomatoes are cold, peel the skin off. Drain chiles and transfer to a blender along with the peeled tomatoes, garlic, onion, and chicken broth. Blend until smooth. Heat 1/2 of the corn oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the chile mixture, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with salt. Heat the remaining corn oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken legs in 2 batches and remove from the skillet. Stir the chorizo into the same skillet; cook and stir until the chorizo is evenly browned. Drain any excess oil and stir in 1 cup of the chile sauce. Return the chicken to the skillet, along with the remaining chile sauce. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until chicken is tender, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. This is the way Mexican cooks prepare chicken - so tender and flavorful! Looks complicated, but it is really so easy. Garnish with chopped avocado, onion, radish or cheese, if you want. You could serve this with Mexican rice and/or beans, or just some fresh fruit (mango, pineapple, papaya, etc.)

Cook the steak until it starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). This is a perfect way to cook during the week; low prep time and no mess to clean up. Serve on homemade tortillas and all your fixins.

Stir onion mixture, spinach, and peas into millet; add wine and rosemary and stir. Increase heat to medium, cover saucepan, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 7 to 10 minutes. Add tomatoes, salt, and pepper; return cover and cook until tomatoes soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat and stir Parmesan cheese into millet mixture. A savory vegetarian pilaf of millet and vegetables, flavored with rosemary and wine. My daughter loved that it was made with 'birdseed' and she gave it the silly title.

Mix in the cinnamon and anise-flavored water, vanilla, and salt. Add raisins, if desired. Continue to stir until the mixture thickens, about 7 to 10 minutes. If the pudding is too watery after 10 minutes, turn up heat to medium-low and stir continuously. When pudding reaches desired consistency, remove from heat and pour into individual dishes, or a large bowl. Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve. This Arroz con Leche is the Cuban version of rice pudding. It's richer and sweeter than regular rice pudding. Being Cuban myself, I prefer this version of this delicious dessert to any other. Before serving, sprinkle with cinnamon or garnish with a cinnamon stick, for flair.
Remove the stems from the jalapeno peppers, and the seeds from one jalapeno. Place both jalapeno peppers, tomatoes with liquid, onion, garlic, cumin, oregano, and salt in a blender; pulse to desired consistency. Serve This a quick and easy hot sauce my dad makes with canned tomatoes, jalapeno peppers, and spices. My mom had to go behind him to write down what he was tossing in.

Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pan fry the chicken breasts until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes on each side. Place the browned chicken in the prepared baking dish; then cover with the mushroom soup mixture. Bake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). We often spend weekends at our family vacation home on Lake Chelan.

Form cheese mixture into two 5-inch balls. Roll each ball in the pecan mixture until fully coated, adding more pecan mixture as needed. I just wasn't satisfied with the ingredients in other cheese ball recipes. So, I made my own and took it to a Christmas party, where it was enjoyed by all. You can also experiment with other Greek-themed ingredient options such as sun-dried tomatoes, Kalamata or green olives, pepperoncini, etc. Surround cheese balls with your favorite crackers.  For a true 'Greek' theme, try toasted pita chips.

Repeat layering twice more. Heat milk in a saucepan until warm. Pour enough warm milk over the mixture in the baking dish so the top of the liquid is level with the final layer of potatoes. Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 45 to 60 minutes. This is the way my mother always made her scalloped potatoes. The measurements are taken from other recipes because she always just winged it, but the method is the same. The key is to heat the milk first!
Mix salmon, panko, parsley, eggs, green onions, seafood seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce, Parmesan cheese, Dijon mustard, and creamy salad dressing together in a large bowl; divide and shape into eight patties.

Stir in brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  Fold in bread crumbs.  Stir in raisins.  Pour into prepared dish. Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until set. Bread crumbs and banana are spiced with sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and sweetened with applesauce and brown sugar in this baked pudding.
Mix together flour, warm water, and yeast in a large glass bowl.  Let stand uncovered in a warm place over night or up to 48 hours.  The longer the mixture stands, the stronger the ferment will be. After fermenting, the starter is ready to use or to store covered in the refrigerator.  Feed once or twice a week with 1 cup milk, 1 cup flour, and 1/4 cup sugar; allow the starter to rest at room temperature for several hours after feeding. Prepare the starter in a glass container.  Store the covered container in the refrigerator when the starter is done.  The starter dough may smell very sour and liquid may form on its surface, but this is normal.  Stir the starter before each use.  After using some of the starter, be sure 1 cup of starter is left in the container.
Mix soup, cheeses, milk and black pepper in 1 1/2-qt. casserole.  Stir in pasta. Bake at 400 degrees F. for 20 min. or until hot. Tender corkscrew pasta is cloaked in a creamy mushroom sauce sporting flavors of three cheeses.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.  Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. In a large bowl combine flour, wheat germ and salt.  Make a well in the middle and add honey and yeast mixture.  Stir well to combine.  Cover and set in a warm place to rise for a few minutes. Roll dough on a floured pizza pan and poke a few holes in it with a fork. Bake in preheated oven for 5 to 10 minutes, or until desired crispiness is achieved.

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). In an 8 inch cast iron skillet, heat vegetable oil over low heat. In a medium bowl, mix together cornmeal, buttermilk, egg and honey. Carefully stir in the hot oil. Sprinkle skillet with remaining 1 tablespoon corn meal. Spoon mixture into skillet. Bake in preheated oven for 22 minutes, or until firm. Serve hot. Nothing is easier and tastes better with eggs and country ham than good Southern cornbread. If you can find sorghum molasses, use it instead of the honey in this recipe.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a medium bowl, mix together the artichoke hearts, Parmesan cheese, mayonnaise, and garlic pepper. Place chicken in a greased baking dish, and cover evenly with artichoke mixture. Bake, uncovered, for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear. This is the most flavorful chicken you will ever have in your life! It is melt in your mouth to die for!
In a large freezer container, combine water and sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Stir in orange juice concentrate, lemonade concentrate and peach schnapps. Cover and freeze for 4 hours or overnight. To serve, fill glass 3/4 of the way full with slush, then top off with lemon-lime soda, and stir. This is a great slush for those who enjoy the drink by the same name.
Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pork, carrot, broccoli, and green onion in melted butter until pork is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove pork mixture to a bowl and return skillet to medium heat. Scramble egg in the skillet until completely set. Return the pork mixture to the skillet. Stir rice, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger into the pork mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes. This is my revised version of another pork fried rice recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.
In a large pitcher, mix together lemonade concentrate and water. Stir in strawberries. This is a very tasty and extremely easy drink to make. Everyone will love it!

Arrange on greased sheet, spacing 1inch apart. Bake cookies at 275 F (135 degrees C) until firm and tops appear dry, about 25-30 minutes. Cool cookies completely on racks. To Make Icing: Blend 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar and 2 teaspoons egg white. Mix in enough liqueur to make thick but pourable icing. Set racks on waxes paper; arrange cooled cookies on racks with edges touching. Drizzle icing over cookies in irregular lines. Separate cookies. Let stand until icing is dry. Store in airtight container. These treats of Italian origin are best served the day after.
In a large bowl, combine confectioners sugar, shortening, milk, salt, butter flavored extract and vanilla. Beat until smooth and fluffy. This easy white frosting is perfect for wedding cakes.
Preheat a grill for high heat. In a large bowl, combine the ground turkey, soup mix, and water. Season with salt and pepper. Mix lightly using your hands, and form into 4 patties. Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill patties 5 to 10 minutes per side, until well done. I love to cook and I'm always trying out new recipes on my family. This was an easy and scrumptious new meal idea! My family loved it. Serve on buns with lettuce, tomatoes, and condiments.
Soak the rosemary skewers in water for 30 minutes.  Meanwhile, whisk together the garlic, thyme, olive oil, sherry vinegar, salt, and pepper in a glass bowl.  Toss the lamb pieces in the marinade, and allow to marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.  After the lamb has marinated, thread onto the rosemary sprigs. While the lamb is marinating, prepare the salsa verde by placing the lemon juice, olive oil, yogurt, garlic, salt, mint, oregano, parsley, capers, and anchovy filet into the bowl of a blender.  Blend until smooth, then pour into a serving dish and set aside. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Cook the lamb skewers, turning occasionally, until no longer pink, about 8 minutes.  Serve with salsa verde. Pieces of lamb tenderloin are marinated in garlic, oil, and sherry vinegar, then threaded on rosemary skewers and grilled. A creamy salsa verde of Greek yogurt, fresh mint, oregano, and parsley complement these skewers nicely!
Heat olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in shallots and garlic, and cook until tender. Stir in fennel and tomato, and continue cooking about 5 minutes. Mix white wine, ouzo, and heavy cream into the saucepan, and bring to a boil. Gradually stir in mussels, 1/2 the basil, and salt. Cover saucepan, and continue cooking about 5 minutes, until the mussels have opened. Garnish with remaining basil to serve. Pick good fresh and alive mussels for this dish, preferably Penn Cove. The fresher the better. This recipe is simply amazing in flavor. You will love it. Serve with a slice of bread.
In a medium bowl, mix together the cream cheese and cocktail sauce until well blended. Stir in crabmeat, Swiss cheese, and green onion. Spread about 1/2 cup of the mixture onto each tortilla, and roll up tightly. Wrap each tortilla in plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight. Slice rolls into 1/2 inch circles, and arrange on a serving tray with a bowl of cocktail sauce for dipping. This is an easy and delicious spread, and yet another way to use tortillas for an appetizer. The mixture can also be used without the tortillas as a spread on crackers.
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease and flour a 15x20-inch baking dish. Whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Mix together the shortening, ginger, and molasses until smooth. Stir in the flour mixture until no dry lumps remain. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Let cool for 15 minutes. Cut into 2-inch squares. Cool 2 to 3 more hours before serving. This is a simple recipe for ginger bread. It is sold mostly in the Chiriqui province of Panama and is very popular. It uses fresh ginger so the flavor is hot and delicious. Try it with a glass of warm milk!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the spinach, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, processed cheese food, 1/2 the butter, vinegar, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Mix well and set aside. Place a layer of phyllo dough into the bottom of a lightly greased 2-quart casserole dish. Spread the spinach and cheese mixture into the dish and top with 4 layers of phyllo dough, spraying each layer with butter-flavored cooking spray. Drizzle the remaining butter over the top. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 20 minutes. I use this as a main dish casserole, side dish or as an appetizer--whatever the occasion calls for. If you prefer, you may also add 1 can of rotel tomatoes to the cheese-spinach mixture for a little zing.
In a small saucepan heat soup with milk over low heat; when heated through, set aside. Meanwhile, roll chicken in bread crumbs, pressing hard to make sure chicken is well coated. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place coated chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish and drizzle with oil, then sprinkle with chopped garlic. Stir chicken broth into soup mixture, and pour mixture all over chicken. Sprinkle with mushrooms, then squeeze lemon over all. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. This chicken dish is a favorite that I frequently make while I am on vacation down on Barnegate Bay in New Jersey. It has a wonderful hint of garlic, and has just the right amount of lemon. I love this recipe because, not only is it delicious, but you can use more or less of the ingredients required. It's all up to you! Remember to serve this with white rice because the sauce is just delicious when mixed in with it. Enjoy!
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Place the oats, almonds, walnuts, and soy nuts into a food processor.

Beat the egg whites until frothy in a small bowl; stir in the canola oil, honey, and vanilla extract and pour into the dry mixture. Stir until evenly moistened and press into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the mixture is hot, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the power bar mixture by lifting the foil out of the pan. Allow to cool slightly; remove the foil and cut into bars while still warm. Allow to cool completely on a wire rack before serving. Store in airtight container, or freeze in plastic snack bags. These bars are so delicious it's hard to have just one. Bars are so expensive now-a-days and the most of the ingredients listed on the package I don't even know how to pronounce, so I decided to come up with my own recipe so I know what kind of ingredients I am feeding my family.
Heat the oil in a deep, heavy skillet or deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Place the squash in a pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain, and mash. In a bowl, mix 2 cups squash*, onion, and eggs. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, corn muffin mix, baking powder, and salt. Thoroughly blend the squash mixture into the flour mixture. Drop the squash and flour mixture by rounded tablespoons into the hot oil, and fry until evenly brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels.

Bake the chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Place one slice of provolone cheese on top of each chicken breast and return the pan to the oven, baking until the cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Your guests won't know what you've topped the chicken with, but - they WILL love it!!

Serve immediately. This punch is always great for Bridal and Baby showers!  You just can't get enough! You may use different flavors such as lemon lime, orange, strawberry or even a combo of all of them.  You can also substitute the soda for a pitcher of powdered drink mix and 2 liters of ginger ale.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, stir together 4 cups of  flour, baking soda and 1 cup of confectioners' sugar. Cut in 1/3 cup of butter using a pastry blender or by pinching between your fingers until the mixture is crumbly. Make a well in the center, and pour in the eggs, honey and sour cream. Stir until dough comes together. Divide into 4 equal pieces.  Roll each piece of dough out into a equally large rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. Place on the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and lightly golden. Bake in batches if you do not have enough room for all of the sheets at once. Set aside to cool. In a saucepan over medium heat, stir together 2 cups of confectioners' sugar, vanilla sugar, and 1/4 cup of flour. Gradually mix in the milk until smooth. Cook and stir until thick and dense like porridge. Remove from the heat, and stir in the butter. Allow to cool.

This is an old Hungarian pastry recipe my grandmother used to make for special guests.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease the cups of a mini-muffin pan. Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan set over medium heat. Swirl the butter in the pan and continue to cook until it turns golden and smells nutty. Pour the browned butter into a heat-safe bowl, and let it cool to room temperature. In a separate bowl, stir together the almond flour, all-purpose flour, sugar, and salt. Mix in the egg whites, honey, almond extract, and browned butter. Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin cups (a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here). Top each cake with a fresh berry or two (or a dollop of jam). Bake the cakes for 15 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown around the edge and firm to the touch in the middle. Remove the cakes from the oven, and cool them in the pan for 5 minutes before turning them out onto a rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining batter. Also known as financiers or friands, these almond-scented, bite-sized cakes are a perfect treat for a mid-morning or afternoon snack. They're prettiest when filled with fresh berries; but if looks aren't important, a teaspoonful of jam works quite well, also.
In a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the vinegar, ketchup, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, sugar, and water. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until all the sugar dissolves. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove from heat, and let cool. Use to baste your favorite meat while grilling. This is a North Carolina-style BBQ sauce that I have used for years. It's great on any meat. Lots of vinegar - that's the North Carolina way! Be careful though, this one's spicy.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake pans. Separate the eggs. Set the egg yolks aside and beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Cream 2 1/'4 cups sugar, vanilla, and shortening.  Add the egg yolks and beat till smooth. Sift together the cocoa, cake flour, baking soda, and salt.   Then add dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk to creamy mixture.  Lastly, fold in beaten egg whites. Pour into 3 greased and floured cake pans.  Bake 20-25 minutes in 325 degree F (165 degrees C) oven, or until done. To Make Icing:  Cook 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup butter or margarine over low flame until mixture forms a soft ball in water.  Remove from heat, beat about 5 or 6 strokes to make mixture smooth.  Cool, spread between and on layers while lukewarm.  This hardens when cold. This is an old family recipe.  The cake has a delicate chocolate flavor and the icing is hard to the touch, yet creamy when bitten into.
In a blender, combine ice, pineapple juice, rum, coconut cream and heavy cream. Blend until smooth. Pour into glass and garnish with pineapple wedge and cherry. This recipe was originally created by a man called Monchito in Puerto Rico in 1954.  For the kids we used lots of ice cubes instead of crushed ice, and added 1 tablespoon of sugar.  (Of course we omitted the rum!)  It came out thick, creamy, and oh so good.
Cook ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until no longer pink. Stir frequently, and break into pieces. Drain off grease. Add onion, celery, and green pepper to the skillet, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring until onion is soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in ketchup, vinegar, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and tomato sauce. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Spoon onto buns, and serve. This ground beef and vegetable mixture in a tomato based sauce is wonderful served on hamburger buns, but equally good over noodles.
Sift together flour, ginger, and salt. Set aside. In large bowl, cream together shortening and sugar.  Beat in the cream. Gradually blend in the flour mixture. Stir or work in crystallized ginger.

Bake in a 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until lightly colored.  Cool in the pan on  wire rack. Cut into 2 x 1 inch bars. This is a shortbread.  I make it unique by adding 1 tablespoon chopped crystallized ginger to the batter. If you like ginger, you'll love this.
Mix marmalade, water, soy sauce, mojo criollo dressing, brown sugar, orange juice, ginger, garlic powder, and orange zest in a bowl. Measure 1 cup marinade and pour into a large resealable plastic bag; add beef to bag. Seal bag and turn beef inside bag to coat completely. Marinate in refrigerator, turning occasionally, for at least 8 hours to overnight. Cover bowl with remaining marinade and refrigerate. Remove beef from marinade; discard used marinade. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Grill beef on the preheated grill, basting frequently with reserved marinade, until desired doneness is reached, 5 to 10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). I've been experimenting with marinades for years. This recipe is the result of the combined efforts of several friends and a few cookbook recipes.
Combine the corn, peas, beans, onions, celery and radish. Whisk together the salad dressing and milk or cream. Pour over salad, toss and refrigerate overnight. This vegetable salad is good anytime of year. My mother served this in her restaurant. Enjoy

All of your favorite fruits, lightly sweetened, served in a watermelon 'bowl'.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, and 3 tablespoons of reserved pineapple juice. Gently fold in whipped cream and marshmallows. Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl, smoothing top with a rubber spatula or large spoon. Cover, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight. Serve chilled. It seems all families have some weird salad they just can't do without during the holidays, and this is ours. I like to call it 'Christmas Eve Salad, Traditionally Served on Thanksgiving.' My Mother always referred to it as 'light' and 'refreshing.' Well, refreshing maybe. Goes great with holiday ham, and looks pretty in a clear glass bowl.
Place the sliced avocados into a food processor. Set the processor on medium and slowly add salsa until the texture is lumpy. Add the garlic powder and hot sauce.

Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping has melted and the sauce is bubbling, about 40 minutes. These delicious rolls use low-fat cheeses, egg whites, and whole wheat lasagna noodles to increase their nutrition. The noodles are rolled around a ball of filling, as opposed to spreading the filling over the noodle. The technique is quicker and not as messy and results with nice looking cannoli-type roll.
The bean hole should be 2 1/2 to 3 feet deep, depending on your pot. The hole should be big enough around to have a 6 inch space between the pot and the edge of the hole on all sides. To help hold heat, put some old tire chains or stones in the hole before starting the fire. Start the fire and keep it filled with good dry hardwood. Let it burn for about 3 hours.  The hole should be at least 3/4 full of hot coals. After the fire has been going for about an hour, place the beans in a large pot, on the stove with water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until skins roll back when you blow on them, about 45 minutes. Watch closely, because they will get mushy if left too long. When the hole is ready, cut the salt pork in to 2 inch wide and 1/4 inch thick slices. Place them into the bottom of the bean pot. Peel and cut the onions in half; lay them on top of the pork. Pour the beans and their liquid into the pot, then mix in the molasses, black pepper and dry mustard. Slice butter and place on top. Add enough boiling water to cover the beans by one inch. Cover the top of the pot tightly with aluminum foil so that it goes down over the sides by at least 2 inches. Place lid onto bean pot. Before putting the pot into the hole, remove about 1/3 of the coals using a shovel. Remove and discard any burning pieces of wood. Place the bean pot into the hole, and put the coals from the hole back in around the sides and over the top of the bean pot. Now start filling the hole in with the dirt, packing it down with your feet as you go. You should end up with about 2 feet of dirt covering the pot. Cover the place where the beans are buried with a tarp or piece of metal to keep out rain. Let the beans stew overnight in their bean hole. Carefully dig them out the next day and enjoy!

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make three slashes across each side of the fish using a sharp knife. This will keep the fish from curling as it cooks. Place the fish in a shallow baking dish or roasting pan. Cover each side with fresh ginger, then green onions and tomatoes. Season with sea salt. Slice half of the lime and place the slices on top of the fish. Drizzle with the soy sauce, and squeeze the other half of the lime over the fish. Cut the lemon in half and set in the pan. Cover the whole dish with aluminum foil. Bake the fish until the flesh is opaque and can be flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Squeeze the baked lemon halves over the fish before serving. Serve the fillet on the top side first, then gently lift out the backbone, while helping the flesh off the bones with your knife. It's much easier than trying to turn the fish over. This is such an easy dish to cook and healthy way to eat fish. It is so versatile you can eat it during the week in front of the TV or for a dinner party!

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 6 cup ring mold. Combine the egg, peanut butter, oil, vanilla, and honey, if desired, in a large bowl; blend well. Stir in the carrots and mix thoroughly. Sift together the flour and baking soda and fold into the carrot mixture. Spoon cake batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 10 minutes; then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. I made this one year for my dog and she ate it all up.  The honey is optional, but it makes it sweeter for the dog...and yes, I tried some. It's pretty good.

Preheat a grill for medium-low heat. Cut a sheet of aluminum foil to about 12x15 inches. Arrange the green onions side by side in the center of the foil sheet. Sprinkle the onions evenly with the garlic, salt, and pepper. Arrange butter over the onions. Keeping the green onions flat, fold the foil to make a sealed cooking pouch. Place the foil packet on the preheated grill away from the main heat source. Allow the green onions to steam 5 to 7 minutes. Whether you love or hate green onions, this steamed version will make your taste buds smile and impress all your grilling buddies. I also use this aluminum foil cooking pouch method for grilling mushrooms and peppers. Awesome!

You can get dried wakame seaweed in health food or Asian specialty stores. Serve warm or cold.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer onion to a large mixing bowl. Stir corned beef, cream cheese, mayonnaise, sour cream, Swiss cheese, and garlic powder into onion. Mix until thoroughly combined. Slice a piece of bread from the top of the Italian bread and hollow the center of the loaf, creating a long bread bowl. Leave at least 1/2 inch of bread on the sides. Reserve bread chunks from center of loaf for dipping if desired. Spoon the corned beef mixture into the bread bowl. Wrap the filled bread bowl in aluminum foil and place on a baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the dip is fully cooked and bubbling, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Warm and delicious corned beef dip. Serve with crackers or toast the hunks of bread taken from the center of the Italian loaf. You can also bypass the bread altogether and bake in a 9x13 covered pan.  I have also cooked this in a slow cooker on Low for 3 hours.
In a small bowl, thoroughly mix the tomato sauce and soda. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, spices and salt.  Mix in tomato sauce and soda mixture.

Tomato sauce is the secret special ingredient in this easy recipe for a spice cake packed with walnuts and raisins.
Shred zucchini with the shredding blade of a food processor and toss with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a colander. Let the zucchini drain for 2 to 3 hours if possible. Transfer zucchini to several layers of paper towels and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in portobello mushrooms and cook until mushrooms have released their liquid, the juice has evaporated, and the mushrooms are browned, about 15 minutes. Stir shredded zucchini into the mushrooms and cook, stirring often, until the zucchini are tender but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain. Transfer linguine into a large serving bowl. Toss pasta with zucchini-mushroom mixture, Parmesan cheese, and mushroom Alfredo sauce, tossing until thoroughly combined. A much lighter pasta Alfredo recipe that's packed with veggies and flavor, but tastes as good as the original. Linguine is extended with shredded zucchini 'noodles' to lower the calorie count and up the nutrition! I promise you can't even tell the zucchini is in there. A great way to use up summer's zucchini abundance too!
Combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, lime juice, crushed red pepper, sesame oil, and soy sauce in a food processor. Season mixture with salt and pepper. Pulse until pork is minced to the consistency of ground beef. Separate the wonton wrappers and lay them out on a clean surface. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water, fold over the filling to form a triangle, and press together to seal. Brush each wonton with egg white. Pour the peanut oil into a large pot and preheat to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Gently drop wontons into the hot oil and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Remove to paper towels to drain. These homemade wontons are stuffed with pork flavored with ginger and garlic before being deep fried to a crispy texture.
Process garlic, paprika, and salt in a food processor until smooth. Add mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, and ketchup; process until sauce is well-combined.

Rinse luncheon meat 'fries' with cool water and pat dry. Working in batches, cook 'fries' in preheated oil until browned and crispy on the outside and still moist on the inside, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Transfer 'fries' to a plate and serve with chilled dipping sauce. SPAM® is an oft-maligned meat product in a can that you either love or hate! If you're not vegan with a gluten allergy who runs marathons but doesn't own a TV, this little appetizer will surely please!
In a large bowl, whisk together the five-spice powder, ginger, sake, rice vinegar, tamari, and sesame oil.  Add the tuna steaks and turn to coat; allow to marinate for 30 minutes. Combine the crushed wasabi peas and brown sugar.  Remove the tuna steaks from the marinade, and press into the pea mixture to coat.  Pour the marinade into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium, and simmer until the sauce has reduced and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. While the sauce is cooking, sear the tuna in a small amount of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat to desired doneness.  Pour sauce over tuna to serve. This game fish will bite 'cha back! I serve this seared tuna garnished with a julienne of leek, carrot, snow peas and mung beans.
Beginning several days before you hope to be eating this bread, rinse the wheat berries in cool water, drain and submerge the berries with cool water in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with a plate or cloth, and allow the berries to soak at normal room temperature overnight or for about 12 hours. The berries will soak up a considerable amount of water. Drain the berries in a colander, cover the colander with a plate to prevent the berries from drying out, and set it in a place away from light and where the sun won't shine on it.  Rinse the berries about 3 times a day, and they will soon begin to sprout. In a couple of days the sprouts will reach their optimum length of about l/4 inch. Growth depends on moisture and temperature so be patient. Grind in a food mill or in a food processor. After grinding, dump the mushed up grain onto a clean work surface. Squeeze and knead the grain for about 10 minutes, and then form up 2 small round, hearth-style loaves with your hands. Sprinkle an insulated cookie sheet with a little bran or cornmeal, and put the loaves on it. Preheating the oven is not necessary. Cover the loaves with cloches, and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Then turn the oven down to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and bake for approximately 2 hours and 15 minutes more. Allow the breads to cool thoroughly on cooling racks for several hours, and then, because of the high moisture content, store in the refrigerator. For best results, slice this bread thinly, or break with hands This is a sprouted bread recipe - very old, and said to have been created back in the biblical days.  Also, this recipe literally, takes days to make. Your efforts and time will be well rewarded with a couple of the most singular breads-solid, sweet, and moist. Wheat berries are available from your local natural foods store.  Traditionally, Essene bread was probably baked on hot rocks under scorching sunlight, but where I and most of us live, this is not possible. Baking at the oven temperatures which I suggest might destroy the sprout enzymes, but monitoring baking loaves for much longer than 2 hours is too long for me. Guaranteeing the preservation of the enzymes might require baking at a very low temperature for perhaps 4 hours. If you have the stamina, then go for it.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish. Mix spinach, cottage cheese, eggs, nutmeg and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Stir flour into Cheddar cheese and Swiss cheese in another bowl until cheeses are coated; add cheese mixture to spinach mixture. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the center of the spinach mixture does not wiggle, 25 to 30 minutes. Not really a souffle since the eggs are not separated, but it is not as tricky either.  You can use fresh spinach by steaming two 1-pound bags.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Whisk flour, muffin mix, brown sugar, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt together in a bowl.

Beat half-and-half and egg together in a bowl until frothy; slowly stir into flour mixture using a rubber spatula until dough forms. Knead dough 4 to 5 times. Roll dough into a rectangle onto a lightly floured work surface using your hands. Cut rectangle in half diagonally and each half into 4 triangles, making 8 triangles. Arrange triangles on the prepared baking sheet. Whisk egg white and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl; brush over each triangle. Bake in the preheated oven until scones are golden brown, about 20 minutes. This is a lighter scone version that goes well with a warm drink in the morning and is an easy recipe for kids to try.
Brown ground beef and sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain fat. Stir in the cheese cubes; cook over medium heat until melted, stirring constantly.

Leftovers freeze very well.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, place the pasta in a large bowl, and set aside. While the pasta is cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the zucchini, squash, onion, red and green peppers, and garlic until the vegetables are tender, for about 10 minutes. Pour in the tomatoes, pasta sauce, and corn, and stir to mix. Sprinkle with red and black pepper to taste, and bring the mixture back to a boil. Simmer for 20 minutes.

In a large mixing bowl, combine pumpkin, barley, spinach, cumin, chili powder, and salt and pepper. Lay out a sheet of pastry and place 1/2 of the pumpkin mixture along the center horizontally. Roll the pastry over the mixture, and seal the seams with a little water. Cut stuffed pastry into thirds. Arrange portions on a cookie sheet.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. This roll is delicious, and great served with a French salad.
Heat oven to 300 degrees F. To make the crust, pulse 44 of the RITZ Crackers in a food processor to make about 1 1/2 cups crumbs. In a medium bowl, blend together the crumbs,  cocoa, and sugar.  Mix in melted butter and peanut butter. Press mixture firmly into bottom and up sides of 9-inch pie pan. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, then cool completely on rack. To make the filling, beat the cream cheese, peanut butter, sugar, and vanilla in a medium bowl with mixer until smooth. Stir in the peanuts. Carefully fold a total of 1 1/2 cups whipped cream into the peanut mixture in three additions, until the mixture is a uniform color and no streaks remain. Spread the filling into the cooled crust. Top with remaining whipped cream.  Coarsely crush remaining 4 crackers and sprinkle over the top. Chill completely, at least 2 hours or overnight. Store covered in refrigerator. There's nothing humble about this delicious Peanut Butter Humble Pie. The hint of salt in the RITZ cracker crust paired with a creamy peanut butter mousse will have your guests thinking you got it straight from Serendipity 3! The easy prep is also perfect for any host who would rather get the party started with their guests than spend the day in the kitchen.

After trying a few recipes I developed my own version. I think it's the best!
Heat milk, chocolate, sugar, flour, and salt in a saucepan over low heat. Cook until the chocolate melts, stirring occasionally. Stir about 1/2 cup of the hot chocolate mixture into the eggs, then stir the egg mixture into the saucepan. Increase heat to medium and continue cooking and stirring until the mixture is thickened, about 5 minutes. Pour chocolate egg mixture into a bowl. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours. Stir in the heavy cream and vanilla extract. Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Stir in the coconut and pecans. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight. Coconut, toasted pecans, Baker's® sweet German chocolate, and whipping cream--enough said. To die for! I have made this many, many times--everyone loves it (unless they don't like coconut).
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Crumble and set aside. In a medium sized salad bowl, layer in order the broccoli, cauliflower, eggs, cheese and bacon. Prepare the dressing by whisking together the mayonnaise, sugar and vinegar.

Lightly press into pastry, turn over; repeat.  Cut each sheet into 12 (1-inch) strips; twist. Place on ungreased cookie sheet and bake in 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 15 minutes or until golden brown. These are great as an appetizer or served alongside a meal!
Grate 1 teaspoon lemon zest and set aside. Juice the lemon and whisk 3 tablespoons of the juice with broth, soy sauce and cornstarch in a small bowl. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate with tongs. Add mushrooms and carrots to the pan and cook until the carrots are just tender, about 5 minutes. Add snow peas, scallion whites, garlic and the reserved lemon zest. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Whisk the broth mixture and add to the pan; cook, stirring, until thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add scallion greens and the chicken and any accumulated juices; cook, stirring, until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Spiked with lots of lemon, this delectable chicken stir-fry has a colorful mix of fiber-packed snow peas, carrots and scallions.
Whisk together the oil, sugar, vinegar and soy sauce. Make at least a day ahead and refrigerate. Melt butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add crushed noodles and walnuts; toast until warm. In a salad bowl, combine the Romaine, broccoli, and green onions. Add the dressing, toss and sprinkle with ramen and walnut mixture. The ramen noodle and walnut topping makes this green salad a crunchy delight!  I never have leftovers!
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir water, beef bouillon, and chicken bouillon together in a large pot over medium-high heat until bouillon dissolves. Add pork, rutabaga, carrots, and celery; bring mixture to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until vegetables tender, about 40 minutes. Stir hominy and kidney beans into pork-vegetable mixture and simmer until hominy and meat are tender, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and ground black pepper. On the Akwesasne Reservation where I grew up I have fond memories of corn soup always being on the stove on New Year's Eve. Friends and family would stop in and have a bowl or two and celebrate the end of the year. I continue this tradition with my own family now. Use canned Indian corn instead of hominy if available.
Mix figs, sugar, lemon slices, and strawberry gelatin in a large pot. Let stand for 1 hour. Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat, stirring often to prevent burning, until foam has disappeared and the preserves are thickened, 25 to 40 minutes. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the fig preserves into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into the boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 2 days before opening. Many times people mistake my fig preserves for strawberry or blackberry jam. It is so easy to do, and my kids love the twist on the sometimes-boring fig preserves.
Place the bologna in a large sealable jar. Combine the vinegar, peppers, onion, water, hot pepper sauce, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil; pour over the bologna. Seal the jar. Shake daily. Allow to pickle at least 3 days. For best results, allow bologna to pickle 90 days. This was used as a pickled eggs recipe at Michigan Tech. It's great when served with a cold beer, eh!
Combine graham cracker crumbs and melted margarine, and pat into bottom of 9x13-inch pan. In medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat, combine remaining margarine, confectioners' sugar, eggs, corn starch and vanilla.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Continue stirring, reduce heat and simmer 8 to 10 minutes.  Let cool, then spread over crust. Peel and slice bananas, dipping each piece in lemon juice to prevent browning, and layer over custard mixture. Layer pineapple on top of bananas.  Cover all with whipped topping.  Keep refrigerated until serving. A delicious no-bake dessert, this is the kind for any occasion that everyone loves and wants the recipe for.  Vary crusts using chocolate or vanilla wafers.  Garnish with nuts or cherries.
Place the dried fruit into a small saucepan with the crystallized ginger, sherry, and orange rind. Bring mixture to a boil, remove pan from heat, cover and let cool for 30 minutes. Place walnuts on a baking sheet and toast until golden, about 10 minutes; set aside to cool. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar. Beat in the egg and then the milk. Combine the flour, baking powder, allspice and salt, stir slowly into the egg mixture. Do not over mix. Fold in the walnuts and cooled fruit mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let the loaf cool in the pan 15 minutes before removing it to a wire rack to cool. When the bread has cooled completely, wrap it in plastic. It tastes better if left to sit for a day, and it's especially good with butter or cream cheese. This is a wonderfully aromatic bread with lots of dried fruit. It's rich in fruit, not rich in fat! You can also use prunes, dates, pears or any type of dried fruit in this bread.
Stir together the tomato, onion, cilantro, and honey. Season with lime juice, vinegar, salt and pepper; set aside. Melt bacon grease in a saucepan over medium heat.

Serve topped with pico de gallo. Here's a quick, easy to make supper!  My husband loves to eat beans this way and even offers to wash dishes after eating it!
Drain the tofu and slice horizontally into 4 slices. Pat each slice dry and place on a serving plate. Divide the tomatoes evenly amongst the tofu portions. Top each with about 2 tablespoons of basil pesto and 1/4 cup of Gorgonzola cheese. Garnish with fresh basil leaves. Serve cold. Tofu topped with cherry tomatoes, pesto, fresh basil, and Gorgonzola cheese.  This is served cold and is a perfect springtime meal. If prepared pesto is hard to find, use a mix and prepare according to package directions. 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).  Lightly flour a 9x5 loaf pan. In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, bran, baking soda, and salt; cut in the butter with a pastry blender until the pea sized pieces form.  In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, milk, and mayonnaise.  Stir the yogurt into the flour until just mixed.  Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden. This soda bread is healthy and tastes really good! The texture is moist and chewy, and it feels like an authentic Irish soda bread. Since buttermilk is not available in Japan, I used yogurt and mayonnaise instead.
In a large resealable plastic zipper bag, place flour, seasoned salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Stir the flour and seasonings together, and add the beef stew meat. Seal the bag and shake several times to coat the beef cubes with seasoned flour. Brush off excess flour. Heat half of the canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry half of the beef cubes, turning them over until all sides are nicely browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove the browned beef to a plate, and repeat with the rest of the canola oil and beef cubes. Transfer to plate, and cook and stir the onion in the hot skillet until translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk together beef broth, mushroom soup, and skim milk until smooth. Return the beef cubes to the skillet together with any juices on the plate, add the mushrooms, and pour the broth mixture over the beef and mushrooms. Turn heat to low, and simmer until the meat is very tender, about 3 hours. For a thicker gravy, mix cornstarch and water to make a smooth paste, and stir into the gravy. Simmer about 2 minutes to thicken. This is very savory and the best beef tips I've ever made! Serve over mashed potatoes or steamed rice.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix peaches, 3/4 cup white sugar, brown sugar, butter, cornstarch, vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and salt in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir until sugars are dissolved and butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle each biscuit with 1 pinch cinnamon, 1 pinch white sugar, and 1 pinch nutmeg. Flatten biscuits on a lightly floured surface using a rolling pin. Cut each flattened biscuit into 12 to 15 small squares; stir into peach mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes. Pour peach-biscuit mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish and allow to thicken for 2 to 3 minutes; cover or decorate with pie crust. Cover dish with a sheet of aluminum foil and place dish on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Cool before serving. This is my grandmother's Southern homemade peach cobbler recipe, handed down to my mother in Louisiana. It's made with cinnamon, nutmeg, and buttery morsels of biscuit bits. It tastes great on its own, but even better with vanilla ice cream, a la mode.

Whisk hot sauce, honey, and brown sugar together in a saucepan until smooth. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 30 minutes, whisking frequently. This sauce tastes similar to the sauce used on the sticky fingers at one of my favorite restaurants.  It is easy to make and has endless possibilities for modification.  Try adding a bit of cinnamon or cloves to it.  Honey is used to thicken the sauce, but isn't necessary.  If not using the honey, just use extra brown sugar.
Preheat an oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Place butter in a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on low power until the butter is very soft and slightly melted. Pour in the corn syrup, honey, and molasses, and mix to a smooth, light brown mixture. Score the ham in a diamond pattern about 1/4 inch deep with a sharp knife. With a pastry brush, coat the ham generously with the glaze. Place the ham into a roasting pan, and cover with aluminum foil, taking care not to touch the ham with the foil. Bake the ham for 1 hour and 10 minutes (10 minutes per pound), removing the foil tent every 20 minutes to recoat the ham with glaze. Remove the foil tent, and turn on the oven's broiler. Broil the ham until the glaze is slightly darkened, about 10 minutes. Remove ham from oven, let stand about 10 minutes, then carve and serve. I created this glaze this past Thanksgiving holiday to cover a ham. My usual recipe called for brown sugar which I neglected to buy when doing my holiday grocery shopping. In my compromise, I created a glaze so amazing it would be a crime not to share it with the world.
Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a saucepan, boil chicken with chicken broth, over low heat, for about 1 hour or until done. Add water, if necessary, to cover chicken while cooking. Drain and reserve the broth, and place cooked chicken in a large bowl. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Add egg, white wine and 1 cup of chicken stock to the cooked chicken. Add dates, ground almonds and cheese, then toss to mix. Add salt, black and white pepper, cloves, ginger, mace and cinnamon. Mix spices in. Don't worry if the filling seems wet, it will thicken as it cooks. Pour filling into pie shell. Cover with top shell and crimp to seal edges. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes to an hour. This is a kind of meat pie that would have been eaten during the Middle Ages (700-1450) in Europe. Feel free to play around with the spices and substitute things such as cardamom, allspice, nutmeg, etc. Use a Whole wheat crust to be really authentic.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix rhubarb, strawberries, and 1/4 cup sugar in a bowl; spread fruit mixture into prepared baking dish and sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup sugar on top. Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Beat 2/3 cup sugar and butter with an electric mixer set on medium speed in a large bowl until fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes. Beat egg and almond extract into butter mixture until incorporated, about 3 minutes more. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream, mixing until just incorporated. Batter will be thick. Spoon batter evenly over rhubarb mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. I've been making pudding for years and stumbled on a recipe last year that caught my attention and taste buds. I've made it and changed it and now it's the only one I make; hope you enjoy it. Raspberries or just about any other fruits could be used with the rhubarb, this recipe offers endless possibilities.
Pour whole box of pasta into a large skillet (approximately 12 inches in diameter). Pour 3 cups of cold water into the pan, ensuring that the water covers the pasta.

Set aside to cool and thicken. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir celery, green onions, and bell pepper in hot butter until tender, about 10 minutes; add to pot with the roux. Stir water, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt, hot pepper sauce, and thyme into the vegetable mixture. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 1 hour. Stir okra into the vegetable mixture and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Add catfish, stir gently, and cook until the flesh is easily flaked with a fork, about 5 minutes. Gently stir shrimp into the mixture; cook until the shrimp are bright pink, about 3 minutes. Season with the file powder and salt; stir. This from-scratch gumbo takes a little bit of time, but is well worth the effort! No bouillon, chopped tomatoes, chicken, sausage, or bacon here! Impress your Cajun friends with this wonderful gumbo. Serve over white rice with a side of French bread. Enjoy!
Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil; cover, remove from heat, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. In a large bowl, combine the egg, mayonnaise, mustard, dill, paprika, onion and salt and pepper. Mash well with a fork or wooden spoon. Serve on bread as a sandwich or over crisp lettuce as a salad. This is my favorite recipe for egg salad because it uses little mayonnaise and plenty of dill.
Pour lemon juice, soy sauce, and Tabasco in a large, glass bowl.  Stir in the green onions and beef.  Add additional lemon juice if needed to cover the beef. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and allow to rest at room temperature for one hour, until the meat turns a grayish-brown color and appears cooked. This is my dad's Kelaguen recipe, from Dededo, Guam.  This is no-heat cooking, the meat 'cooks' in the marinade.  I serve this over rice.
In mixer bowl, beat butter, granulated sugar, cream cheese, egg yolk, 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, vanilla and salt until well blended.  Add flour, mix well.  Chill 2 hours.

Arrange meatballs onto baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 18 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). These meatballs with spicy Italian turkey sausage, spicy Italian ground turkey, Cheddar cheese, egg, onion, and seasoning are great for snack or in your spaghetti. I use these as a great snack item. I use small snack-size bags, place three in each bag, and freeze. I'll have one serving of three as a snack by removing them from snack bag and reheating them for 60 to 75 seconds.
Place red pepper and Malbec wine in a blender, while wearing gloves; blend until smooth. Transfer to a large stockpot. Blend habanero pepper, pomegranate juice, and lemon juice in blender until smooth; add to stockpot. Stir all the pectin and butter into pepper mixture. Bring to a rolling boil; stir in sugar. Continually stir until sugar is dissolved, 2 minutes. Remove from heat, stir for 5 minutes, and skim foam off the top. Sterilize jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4-inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars into boiling water using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary to bring water level to at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring water to a rolling boil, cover the pot, and process for 15 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area. As a hot-sauce addict and after YEARS of experimenting, I have finally come up with the perfect balance of scorch and yumminess. This jelly should be poured onto a brick of cream cheese and served with your favorite cracker. You will need a food processor or blender to mince all these peppers before measuring into blender. Gloves to protect your hands are also strongly recommended. Substitute blackberry or blueberry juice for pomegranate if you like.
Mix sour cream, ranch dressing, and taco sauce together in a bowl until Southwest sauce is smooth. Cover bowl and refrigerate for flavors to blend.

Arrange tortillas on the grill and lower heat to medium-low under tortillas. Add Cheddar cheese and Colby-Jack cheese to tortillas; cook until cheeses melt, 2 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking hamburger patties until cooked through, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Spread Southwest sauce onto 1/2 of the tortillas; top with lettuce and picante sauce. Place 1 hamburger patty on top of picante sauce layer and top patty with a tortilla, creating a sandwich. This is a great twist on the hamburger that everyone is sure to love! It's a combination of southwest and the classic American hamburger. I have three kids who all eat very differently from one another and this was a hit for them as well as hubby! I like to serve these with either sweet potato fries or green bean fries!

Pour 1/2 cup of warm water into a small bowl, and stir in the yeast and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Allow the yeast mixture to stand until it forms a creamy foam layer on top, 5 to 10 minutes. Place milk and vegetable shortening into a small saucepan over medium-low heat and cook until the shortening has melted and the milk has tiny bubbles around the edge. Remove from heat. Place 1/4 cup of sugar and the salt into the work bowl of a large stand mixer and pour the milk and shortening into the bowl. Mix on low speed just to dissolve sugar; and allow mixture to stand until warm. Beat in the yeast mixture, eggs, and 1 cup of flour on low speed until smooth. Gradually beat in remaining flour to make a soft dough. Continue beating the dough on low speed until dough leaves the sides of the bowl, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 2 or 3 more minutes. Form the dough into a ball and place into a large greased bowl. Grease the top of the dough, and cover the bowl with waxed paper. Set the bowl into a warm place; let the dough rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down the dough and roll out on a floured work surface to 1/2 inch thick. Cut doughnuts out of the dough with a 3 1/2-inch round doughnut cutter with a 1-inch smaller cutter in the center. Let the doughnuts rise on the work surface until very light and fluffy, 40 minutes to 1 hour. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Gently pick up and drop the doughnuts into the hot oil, working in small batches of 2 or 3 at a time, and cook until the doughnuts are light golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes. Drain the doughnuts on paper towels to absorb oil. In a bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of warm water and vanilla extract, and stir in the confectioners' sugar to make a glaze. Spread a thin layer of glaze over the warm doughnuts. I used to make these with Mom as a little girl. She would make dozens a week and give to neighborhood kids.

Stir as little as possible, and add the remaining flour as necessary to make dough thick enough to roll out. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough 1/4 inch thick. Cut into desired shapes with cookie cutters. Place cookies 1 inch apart on the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in preheated oven. Cool on baking sheets. This recipe puffs up to make great Sugar cookies. My Great Grandfather was a baker, and this is the kind the bakery made. To make sour milk, add a teaspoon of vinegar to regular milk, and let stand for 5 minutes.
in a large bowl, mix together sweetened condensed milk, coffee creamer and hazelnut liqueur. Fold in whipped topping. Pour into pie crusts, and lightly sift cocoa on top.

Gradually beat confectioners' sugar into creamed butter mixture on low until incorporated. Beat in 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and lemon zest until smooth and creamy. Spread frosting over cooled cupcakes; sprinkle about 1 teaspoon shredded coconut onto each cupcake. This is a great cupcake recipe that I created. Lemon and coconut together is such a great combo. If you want, you can substitute lime zest for the lemon zest in the frosting, for lime coconut cupcakes instead. You can also add no zest at all to make regular coconut cupcakes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add kielbasa and boil for 8 to 10 minutes to reduce the amount of fat; drain.

Heat vegetable oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Fry garlic and cumin seeds in hot oil until the garlic browns, about 5 minutes; stir into the soup. This is the recipe from Shalimar Restaurant in Albany, NY. It is amazing. Enjoy this soup with some vegetable samosas and cheese naan bread. As with most soups, the longer you cook it, the more flavorful it is. Also, this soup is better when its a little thicker rather than watery.
In a small mixing bowl, combine the ranch dressing and Sriracha. Reserve refrigerated. In a separate mixing bowl, combine shrimp, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and lime juice. Toss to combine. Heat a saute pan over medium high heat until hot. Add olive oil, then the shrimp, and saute until pink and cooked through (about 2 to 3 minutes), turning often to cook evenly.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish with vegetable shortening. Beat egg whites in a metal, glass, or ceramic bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Set aside. Place the egg yolks, oil, and orange juice into a mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy and thick, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 cup of sugar, mixing well, then lightly stir in the matzo cake meal and salt. Use a rubber spatula or wire whisk to fold about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the matzo meal mixture. Gently run the spatula through the center of the mixture, then around the sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated. Add the remaining egg whites, folding until just incorporated. Mix together 3/4 cup of sugar with cinnamon in a bowl. Spread half the batter into the prepared baking pan; distribute the apple quarters evenly over the batter. Sprinkle the apple pieces with about 1/2 cup of the sugar-cinnamon mixture, spread the remaining batter over the apples; sprinkle the remaining sugar-cinnamon mixture over the top of the cake. Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Cut into squares while still warm. Unbelievably moist cake. Most Passover desserts are very dry but this cake is incredibly moist.
Whisk together the olive oil, rice wine vinegar, rosemary, and oregano in a large bowl. Add small and large tomatoes, and toss until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, 10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Toss again before serving. During the summertime, farmers markets have a great selection of heirloom tomatoes for a reasonable price. This is great as a cold salad, or for a different twist, grill straight on the BBQ for a warm but fresh side dish.
Wash clams to remove any dirt or sand. In a large pot, heat oil over medium heat.  Add garlic; saute for 1 minute, or until tender.  Pour in the white wine.

Warm the nacho cheese dip in the microwave until liquid. Pile the tortilla  chips onto a serving platter. Spoon the ground beef over them and pour the cheese sauce over the top. Serve immediately. I was looking for a way to use up left over sloppy joes after a potluck and came up with this. Hearty and good. It's perfect for football season!
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Season the pork with salt and pepper. Add the pork to skillet and stir to coat with oil. Place the jalapeno peppers into the pan and cover; allow to simmer 20 minutes. Uncover and remove the jalapenos from the pan; chop roughly and set aside. Continue cooking the pork, uncovered, until it browns completely and the liquid evaporates, about 10 minutes. Mix in the onion and garlic; cook and stir about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook 1 minute more. Pour the tomatoes and chopped jalapenos into the pan and stir through the pork. Season with the cumin. Stir, cover, and reduce heat to low; simmer another 10 minutes. This is a spicy pork dish with much flavor that goes really well with Mexican fideo (vermicelli pasta) or white rice. Add more or less jalapenos to suit your taste.
Gently mix peaches, jalapeno pepper, red onion, red bell pepper, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, and lemon juice in a bowl; season with salt and black pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Fold avocado into the salsa to serve. Fresh peaches with creamy avocado, bell pepper, onions, and jalapeno make a great summertime salsa. Use as a topper for grilled fish or chicken, or just dip tortilla chips in it. Not a fan of avocados? The salsa is just as great without it. The longer it can marinate, the better it is.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x9-inch square baking pan. Whisk 2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt together in a mixing bowl; set aside. Toss the blueberries in a little of the flour mixture until coated; set aside. Beat the shortening and 1 cup sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg.  Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the floured blueberries, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pan. To make the topping, combine 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup flour, and the cinnamon in a bowl. Cut in the cold butter with a pastry blender until no small pieces of butter remain. Stir in the toasted coconut, then sprinkle the topping evenly over the cake. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour and 10 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. I have altered my grandmother's famous blueberry cake recipe to my personal liking. The toasted coconut crumble topping is a wonderful addition to the cake.
Place the chopped bacon and onion in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir until the bacon is crisp and the onion is beginning to brown, about 10 minutes.

Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain pasta, transfer to a large serving bowl, and stir in the olive oil to coat the pasta. Drain the bacon grease from the skillet, leaving a couple of tablespoons or to taste. Stir the cooked bacon mixture into the pasta, and sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the pasta. Stir to mix in the cheese, and serve. This pasta recipe is so easy to make and so flavorful, you will want to make it part of your regular dinner routine.  It is a great option for bacon lovers, and those who want something other than red sauce on their pasta.  
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl. Mix 1 1/2 teaspoon of grapefruit juice into milk in a small bowl, and set aside for about 5 minutes. In a large bowl, mash the butter with 3/4 cup of sugar until creamy and well combined, and beat in the egg and grapefruit zest until thoroughly combined. Beat the milk into the butter mixture about 2 tablespoons at a time, alternating with the flour mixture, until the dough is smooth. Drop by teaspoons onto ungreased baking sheets, about 2 inches apart. Bake in the preheated oven until set and very lightly browned, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on racks. Make glaze by mixing 3/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup grapefruit juice. Brush glaze onto cooled cookies; let stand until glaze is set. My mother originally made these in her culinary arts class in high school in 1975 and they were made with lemon. I love the lemon but I wanted to make these and realized I didn't have any lemons so I used what I did have, grapefruit. They turned out wonderful! I bet they would be good made with oranges too. The glaze is different from your regular iced cookie with the granulated sugar giving a nice texture on top. Yummy!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.

Spread vegetable mixture into prepared baking dish and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 35 minutes. Decreasing the fat and egg content makes this a little healthier, as does adding a variety of vegetables. The seasonings make this anything but bland. A great idea for brunch or a side dish! My husband could not stop eating this.
Blend cream cheese, salmon, mayonnaise, celery, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a food processor until smooth. Transfer mousse to a serving bowl and garnish with chives. A great salmon spread on crackers or celery sticks.

Whisk together the brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, rosemary, garlic, and pepper in a large bowl. Reserve 1 tablespoon of marinade in a small bowl, and set aside. Add the salmon and toss to evenly coat. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Remove the salmon from the marinade, and shake off excess. Place salmon in an aluminum foil-lined baking dish, and sprinkle with salt. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Roast in the preheated oven until the fish is easily flaked with a fork, about 10 minutes. Brush salmon with the reserved marinade, and return to the oven. Roast until glazed, about 1 minute. These simple and few ingredients make for quick but elegant entertaining. The final broiling caramelizes the sugar to give the salmon its attractive, mildly sweet glaze.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and stir in yellow rice mix and olive oil; boil for 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Spoon 3 tablespoons yellow rice into the bottom of each pepper. Cover rice with layers of refried beans, corn, and black olives, filling peppers almost to the top. Spoon salsa into peppers. Stand stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender and filling is hot, about 30 minutes. Divide Mexican cheese blend over the peppers, return to oven, and bake until cheese has melted, about 5 more minutes. I'm not a big fan of traditional stuffed peppers, so I make mine Mexican-style! This dish was inspired by the Mexican seven-layer dip. I love to make them on Halloween and carve them to look like jack-o'-lanterns. Serve topped with sour cream and guacamole.
Combine flour, oats, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Mix milk and lemon juice in another bowl; stir in banana. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; fold in rhubarb.

Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven until soft and starting to brown, 20 to 25 minutes; stir and turn over vegetables after about 10 minutes of baking. Decrease oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). While vegetables are roasting, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Grease a 2-quart casserole dish. In a saucepan, mix together the Alfredo sauce with chicken broth, and bring to a boil.

Spoon the mixture into the prepared casserole dish; sprinkle top evenly with breadcrumbs. Cover the dish. Bake in the hot oven until mixture is bubbling, about 30 minutes. Remove cover, and sprinkle top of casserole with remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan and 1/4 cup of mozzarella cheeses; return to oven, and bake until the top is lightly browned and the cheese has melted, 5 to 10 more minutes. Family-friendly baked pasta can be made a day ahead and baked before dinner.  A big hit in my family!  The roasted vegetables add a lot of depth of flavor. You could add frozen spinach (defrosted) but my kids won't touch it with spinach.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a roasting pan with a sheet of aluminum foil. Preheat a large skillet over high heat. Pour in the oil, and heat until smoking. Sear the tenderloin roast in the hot oil until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove to the roasting pan when done.

Roast in preheated oven until the tenderloin has reached your desired degree of doneness, about 40 minutes for medium. This is a delicious way to prepare your beef tenderloin roast. The tastes come together perfectly.
In an electric food processor or meat grinder, grind cranberries, oranges, carrot, and pecans. Pour mixture into a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, combine sugar, pineapple, gelatin and both cups of water. Mix the ingredients from the two bowls together. Pour the entire mixture into a mold and chill overnight before serving. This is one of my Meamaw's recipes for the holidays. It's great for Christmas and Thanksgiving and has been what I've looked forward to during the holidays since I was a little girl. It's also EASY! Hint: make this recipe a day before you serve it so it has time to set.
Trim crusts from bread slices, and cut each slice into thirds. Lay out the slices on cookie sheets to dry out - a few hours or overnight. Turn over once for even drying. It is important that they dry out thoroughly like croutons. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat cookie sheets with cooking spray. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a shallow dish, and put the coconut in a separate bowl. Dip bread pieces in the condensed milk, and then in the coconut. Lay on the greased baking sheets. Bake for 6 to10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly toasted. Be careful, as the sweetened coconut flakes tend to burn easily. Remove from baking sheets and allow to cool. Chewy coconut macaroons using three ingredients BELIEVE me you have to try them! I could never believe my elderly neighbor made these from bread until I tried them myself and I hate condensed milk but not in this recipe!
Slice the pork belly into 2-inch wide strips. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and stir in the pork slices; reduce heat to a simmer, and cook the meat for 10 minutes. Remove from the water, and blot dry with paper towels. Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large wok, and brown the pork strips well on all sides. Pork will splatter - use a splatter shield for this step. While pork is browning, mix together the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, rice wine, rock sugar, ginger, and spring onions in a large soup pot or stockpot. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer, and lay the pork strips into the liquid. Cover, and simmer until the meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add water as needed to keep the liquid from going completely dry. Named after an ancient Chinese statesman, poet and gourmand of the Song Dynasty, the pork belly is cooked three different ways, rendering the meat succulent, tender and very flavorful. (If you can't find pork belly, ask the butcher; it is what bacon is before it is cured and sliced.)

Actually stumbled across this when making Fuzzy Navels. It was a suggested recipe. Thought it might be good to share...interesting. Great party drink. Scales well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot. Melt 2 tablespoons oil and butter together in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk flour into hot oil-butter mixture until mixture has a paste-like consistency. Cook, whisking constantly, until flour mixture is light golden, about 5 minutes. Pour milk into flour mixture, 1 cup at a time, whisking thoroughly until mixture is smooth between additions. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Mix Gouda cheese and Gruyere cheese into milk mixture until completely melted; add Pecorino Romano cheese and stir until melted. Stir 1 tablespoon pepper into cheese mixture. Remove from heat. Heat remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute garlic, pinch of salt, and a pinch of pepper in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add kale; saute until tender, about 15 minutes. Stir cheese sauce, kale, and turkey ham into penne; mix thoroughly. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. A smoky update on the classic baked macaroni and cheese. This would also work with kielbasa as the meat and cooked peas or sauteed spinach (with garlic) as the vegetable. Don't substitute any other cheese for the smoked Gouda. You can sub Ementaller or imported Swiss (Jarlsberg would be great) for the Gruyere. Don't add salt to the sauce. Serve with garlic bread and a side salad.

Mix the chicken broth, peanut butter, honey, soy sauce, chile paste, lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir 5 minutes, until slightly thickened. Mix in the green beans. Serve over rice. Garnish with green onions and peanuts. This is an all time favorite that has lasted me from grade school through adulthood. I've served it to just about everyone I know and have received nothing but rave reviews!

Turn the quince right-side up and bake until tender, about 10 more minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and let the quince cool slightly. Transfer each quince half to a plate and drizzle with a tablespoon of juices from the roasting pan and a dollop of whipped cream. This is a very easy and flavorful autumn dessert. You can substitute any fruit liqueur or sweet red wine for the port. Serve with whipped cream or ice cream.

Tear off 4 pieces of aluminum foil big enough to enclose each portion of ribs. Spray each piece of foil with vegetable cooking spray. Brush the ribs liberally with barbeque sauce and place each portion in its own piece of foil. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bake ribs wrapped tightly in the foil at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) for 2 1/2 hours. Remove from foil and add more sauce, if desired. These are tender and the meat falls right off the bone. Generally, people think of baby back ribs as a meal they would only order when at a restaurant, but they are so easy to make at home. This recipe could not be any more simple.
